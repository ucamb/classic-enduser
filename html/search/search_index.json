If you are having difficulty or receiving MIME Type errors, please see more information about adjusting the MIME Types or Accepted File Extensions in the section on managing security settings . File Display Order \uf0c1 Once files are added to an item, you may click and drag the files into the preferred display order for both public and admin item pages. Files with Thumbnails \uf0c1 Thumbnail previews are created for all files types in Omeka 2.0. If you have access to the config.ini file, you can manage thumbnail configuration . File Size Limitations \uf0c1 Please check with your server administrator, because these settings are server specific and not imposed by the Omeka system. These limitations vary from server to server and we cannot change this for you. If you have a problem uploading files, please first check with your hosting service or your local server administrator. Batch Add Files \uf0c1 To upload more than one file at a time, you may download and install the Dropbox plugin. It allows you to upload multiple files directly into a folder on your server that you can then add in the items admin interface. File Metadata \uf0c1 You may add full Dublin Core metadata for every file uploaded. To add metadata, click the Edit button found to the right of the file name in admin/items/edit. You also may view or edit file metadata from the admin/items/show by clicking the file name under the heading \"File Metadata.\" Alt Text \uf0c1 If a file does not have any metadata (see above), Omeka uses the filename as alt text. If the file has data in its Title property, that text will be displayed as the alt text for that file whereever it appears on the site. Media Files \uf0c1 To keep up with the changing browser support landscape, as of version 2.4 Omeka uses HTML 5 audio and video tags when embedding audio and video, instead of the object and embed tags used by previous versions. This change means generally better support on newer browsers, but worse support on older ones and for older video formats especially. By choosing from a few well-supported formats for audio and video files, you can provide a much better experience for your users across different platforms and devices. Video \uf0c1 MP4 \uf0c1 The MP4 container (.mp4 or .m4v) is the best-supported video format across browsers and platforms. By far the best choice for video that will work well across different browsers is a .mp4 file, with H.264 video and AAC audio. .mp4 files can contain other types of video (or audio), including newer ones like H.265, and older ones like MPEG-4 Visual. Any video codec other than H.264 has much worse browser support. Other Formats \uf0c1 The WebM (.webm) container with VP8 or VP9 video is supported by several browsers, but Internet Explorer and Safari are notable and significant exceptions. The Ogg (.ogg, .ogv) container and Theora video are supported by some browsers, but there is little support among mobile browsers and no support at all on IE or Safari. Audio \uf0c1 MP3 \uf0c1 MP3 (.mp3) is one of the most common formats for compressed audio, and it enjoys wide support across browsers and from desktop to mobile. AAC \uf0c1 AAC is a somewhat newer format than MP3, but it also is well supported in most browsers. The widest support is for AAC in an MP4 container (this usually carries the file extension .m4a), with somewhat lesser support for other containers and formats (often found with a .aac extension). Other Formats \uf0c1 WAV or WAVE (.wav) audio is supported by most browsers (with the notable exception of Internet Explorer). The major downside for use on the Web is that WAV audio is uncompressed, so it takes up vastly more storage space and bandwidth than the compressed formats listed above. If feasible, it\u2019s best to use one of those instead of WAV. Ogg Vorbis audio (.ogg, .oga) is a compressed format like MP3 and AAC, but it has much less widespread support. Expect Vorbis audio to only work on Firefox, Chrome, and Android. Opus (.opus) is one of the newer available audio formats. For the time being, it has a similar problem as Vorbis: a lack of support among browsers, but there are signs that Opus could gain more support in the future. Legacy Formats \uf0c1 There are a lot of media files out there that aren\u2019t in any of the formats listed here. With certain add ons or on certain platforms (like Safari on the Mac in many cases), it can be possible to embed some of those files with HTML 5, but expect many or most users to be unable to play them. Browser plugins can also play many file types, but browsers are steadily reducing and removing their support for these kinds of plugins. For old media, often the best choice is to just present a download link so the viewer can play or convert the file locally. This is what Omeka does when it doesn\u2019t recognize a file type or when a browser reports that it can\u2019t play a file. File formats which result in a download link, rather than an embedded playback, include: Video: avi, wmv Audio: aiff (except Safari), midi, wha If you do not see a format listed here that you think should be, try it out and let us know the results.","title":"Files"},{"location":"Content/Files/#files","text":"When adding items to your archive, often you will upload one or more files (images, documents, et al) associated with that item.","title":"Files"},{"location":"Content/Files/#file-types","text":"Omeka Classic accepts most files and file types.

For shortcodes for Plugins, see the Plugin Shortcodes General \uf0c1 Shortcodes can be added into html text fields. The general syntax is [shortcode key=value] Values can be wrapped in single or double quotes, making the following variations valid as well: [shortcode key='value'] or [shortcode key=\"value\"] Please note that shortcodes will not work with smart quotes. If the shortcode results in an image display (from an item or file), the shortcode will use the Omeka default of displaying the filename or Dublin Core title as alt-text. When using shortcodes on a SimplePage, you should not use the \"HTML editor\" option.

Each tag used on your site appears as a unit which gives you the following (per the number labels in the above image): 1. the number of items with that tag; 2. the name of the tag; 3. the option to delete the tag. Sort Tags \uf0c1 Above the cluster of tags are four button options for sorting the tags. From left to right, they are: Name: The default sort for tags; sorts in alphabetical order by tag name. Click again to sort in reverse alphabetical order (arrow will point down). Count: Initially sorts tags by number of associated records with the largest number first. Click again, so that the arrow which appears next to it points up, to sort with the smallest number occurrences first. Date Created: Sorts records by date created. Default is oldest tags first. An upward pointing triangle indicates an ascending sort. A downwards pointing triangle indicates a descending sort. In addition, there is a drop-down menu to the right of the sort options to limit the tags displayed by Record Types If you have tags on your exhibits as well as items, you can narrow down the tags displayed to show only those associated with items or those associated with exhibits. From the Record Types dropdown, select from the following options: - All - Exhibit - Item Note that if you do not have any exhibits tagged, you will still see the dropdown for Record Types - your options will be All and Items. When you have restricted display by record type, it will not show up in the dropdown but will display near the top of the page.

Edit a Tag \uf0c1 You can rename a tag from this page. Tags edited in the admin panel change on all items across the site wherever they appear. To edit a tag: Click on the name of the tag you wish to edit. Enter changes you would like to make in the field. Hit Enter and your tag is saved with its new name. When editing, you cannot use an existing tag. So, for example if you have 5 tags for \"banana\" and two for \"bananana\", you cannot change the misspelled tag to the right spelling.

Examples: title of a painting, photo, document; the name of a person when using the \"person\" item type; the name of a lesson plan Subject \uf0c1 The topic of the resource. Typically, the topic will be represented using keywords, key phrases, or classification codes. Recommended best practice is to use a controlled vocabulary. To describe the spatial or temporal topic of the resource, use the Coverage element. Examples: Library of Congress subject headings; subject-specific nomenclature. Description \uf0c1 An account of the resource. Description may include but is not limited to: an abstract, a table of contents, a graphical representation, or a free-text account of the resource. Creator \uf0c1 An entity primarily responsible for making the resource. Examples: author; artist; photographer; institutional author or producer, such as university or federal agency Source \uf0c1 The resource from which the described resource is derived. The described resource may be derived from the related resource in whole or in part. Recommended best practice is to identify the related resource by means of a string conforming to a formal identification system. For some examples se the Identifier field. Publisher \uf0c1 An entity responsible for making the resource available. Examples: actual publisher, if there is one; entity or consortium publishing digital materials Date \uf0c1 A point or period of time associated with an event in the lifecycle of the resource.

Date can be one of the trickiest fields to fill. You will want to decide how best to use it for your project for consistency. Where possible, a structured date such as YYYY-MM-DD for a specific day or YYYY for a specific year is preferred, but other formats or levels of specificity can be used (such as \"circa 1940\"). Contributor \uf0c1 An entity responsible for making contributions to the resource. Entries here should be akin to the Creator field, but for entities that made a less significant or unknown contribution. Rights \uf0c1 Information about rights held in and over the resource. Typically, rights information includes a statement about various property rights associated with the resource, including intellectual property rights. Examples: spell out conditions of use for specific items here; Creative Commons or other specific license; Public Domain. Relation \uf0c1 A related resource. Recommended best practice is to identify the related resource by means of a string conforming to a formal identification system. Examples: a still image of a person entered as a \"person\" type. Format \uf0c1 The file format, physical medium, or dimensions of a resource. Examples: the Internet media type of a digital file; the physical size of an object; the duration of a film or audio clip; or the medium of a work of art Language \uf0c1 A language of the resource.

Planning for the content first will help you think about the ways that Omeka Classic can work best for you throughout different stages of the project. Questions to Ask While Planning \uf0c1 These questions will help with those planning steps. What are the primary goals of the website? Who is the primary audience of this website ? Secondary audiences? What do you want these specific audiences to accomplish when they come to the site? What sections will this website include ? Typical top level navigation and sections for a typical Omeka Classic site include: Items : links to a browseable list of items, sortable by type of item and tags. Collections : groups of items, public can dig through collection to find items. Exhibits : Exhibits contain interpretative text and rely on items/sources/objects as their building blocks. About: a simple page good for publishing project descriptions, credits, rights, et al Keyword Search box \u2013 option to link to advanced search page *Note: the labels for Items, Collections, Exhibits, What will I do with items in this website? The item is the building block of your site. First add the objects and materials you want to display in your site. Add descriptions using some or all of the 20 standard Dublin Core fields, plus additional item type-specific fields. Once you have items in the Omeka Classic archive, then you can build an exhibit with them or display categories of items organized by collections or tags. Determine the types of items/sources/objects you plan to use in this site: (ie, Document, Still Image, Moving Image, Audio, et al), Do you want to modify any of the item type fields or types? See Managing Item Types for additional types and explanations. Do you need additional core fields? Install the Dublin Core Extended plugin. It is wise to determine before you start building the item archive what type of consistencies you desire in your metadata--this may be especially true for fields such as date, publisher, creator, et al. Would you like to establish your own Controlled Vocabulary for specific metadata fields, to make it easier for you team to enter consistent data? Install the Simple Vocab plugin. Do you need Library of Congress subject headings? Install Library of Congress Subject Headings plugin. Do you want to establish a controlled tagging schema? You may add tags to individual items and exhibits. Before building your archive you may want to devise this schema to help control vocab and spelling. Tags can help you pull together different items for the purpose of arranging them on a map or creating navigational links to browse items with a specific tag. Do you have materials in other databases or repositories? You may be able to batch add them into your Omeka Classic site. Can items be exported in a Comma Separated Value format? Try the CSV Import plugin. Is there an OAI-PMH harvestable set? Try the OAI-PMH Harvester plugin. Do you have hundreds of files, or large media files? Use the Dropbox plugin. Do you want to display items on a map? Install the Geolocation plugin, you must geolocate each item individually. Are you interested in collecting materials from your visitors through a web form, such as a story or textual reflection, photos, videos, et al. Install the Contribution plugin to facilitate collecting. Do you want to build an exhibit with your items? Install the Exhibit Builder plugin. Decisions for Displaying Items Do you want to add social bookmarking icons to the bottom of items/show to allow users to share links to that item w/their social networks? Install the Social Bookmarking plugin. Do you want to open commenting on items (only available at item level, and for all items or none)? Install the Commenting plugin. Do you want to create and print QR Codes that link visitors in a physical place to individual items in your Omeka Classic site? Install the Bar Code and Reports plugin. Do you have documents that you wish users to read through on the screen rather than downloading them? Install the DocsViewer plugin. Plan an Exhibit \uf0c1 Exhibit Builder is not necessarily only for building museum-like exhibits. This function can be used to publish essays or teaching materials that draw upon the items in your archive. Before you build an exhibit, it is easier to sketch out a storyboard or outline that spells out the sections, pages, and items for each page. Each exhibit is comprised of sections that contains pages. Each page can contain a selection of items and some narrative text, or captions. Follow instructions for using the Exhibit Builder plugin. Create Simple Web Pages \uf0c1 You may wish to use the Simple Pages plugin to create simple web pages for publishing an essay or to create an About or Credits page, or use it to link out to Teacher Resources. Any of those pages can become part of the main navigation for your website. A Simple Page does not require items or require programming knowledge to build, but optionally allows users to add HTML markup, PHP code, or embeds from multimedia web objects. Try Omeka Classic Before Installing \uf0c1 If you would like to try Omeka Classic before installing on your own server, consider signing up for a free basic account at Omeka.net Omeka.net is web-publishing platform that allows anyone with an account to create or collaborate on a website to display collections and build digital exhibitions. With the Basic plan, you can experience Omeka Classic\u2019s administrative dashboard and try out fourteen plugins, including Exhibit Builder and Simple Pages.

Typical top level navigation and sections for a typical Omeka Classic site include: Items : links to a browseable list of items, sortable by type of item and tags. Collections : groups of items, public can dig through collection to find items. Exhibits : Exhibits contain interpretative text and rely on items/sources/objects as their building blocks. About: a simple page good for publishing project descriptions, credits, rights, et al Keyword Search box \u2013 option to link to advanced search page *Note: the labels for Items, Collections, Exhibits, What will I do with items in this website? The item is the building block of your site. First add the objects and materials you want to display in your site. Add descriptions using some or all of the 20 standard Dublin Core fields, plus additional item type-specific fields. Once you have items in the Omeka Classic archive, then you can build an exhibit with them or display categories of items organized by collections or tags. Determine the types of items/sources/objects you plan to use in this site: (ie, Document, Still Image, Moving Image, Audio, et al), Do you want to modify any of the item type fields or types? See Managing Item Types for additional types and explanations. Do you need additional core fields? Install the Dublin Core Extended plugin. It is wise to determine before you start building the item archive what type of consistencies you desire in your metadata--this may be especially true for fields such as date, publisher, creator, et al. Would you like to establish your own Controlled Vocabulary for specific metadata fields, to make it easier for you team to enter consistent data? Install the Simple Vocab plugin. Do you need Library of Congress subject headings? Install Library of Congress Subject Headings plugin. Do you want to establish a controlled tagging schema? You may add tags to individual items and exhibits. Before building your archive you may want to devise this schema to help control vocab and spelling. Tags can help you pull together different items for the purpose of arranging them on a map or creating navigational links to browse items with a specific tag. Do you have materials in other databases or repositories? You may be able to batch add them into your Omeka Classic site. Can items be exported in a Comma Separated Value format? Try the CSV Import plugin. Is there an OAI-PMH harvestable set? Try the OAI-PMH Harvester plugin. Do you have hundreds of files, or large media files? Use the Dropbox plugin. Do you want to display items on a map? Install the Geolocation plugin, you must geolocate each item individually. Are you interested in collecting materials from your visitors through a web form, such as a story or textual reflection, photos, videos, et al. Install the Contribution plugin to facilitate collecting. Do you want to build an exhibit with your items? Install the Exhibit Builder plugin. Decisions for Displaying Items Do you want to add social bookmarking icons to the bottom of items/show to allow users to share links to that item w/their social networks? Install the Social Bookmarking plugin. Do you want to open commenting on items (only available at item level, and for all items or none)? Install the Commenting plugin. Do you want to create and print QR Codes that link visitors in a physical place to individual items in your Omeka Classic site? Install the Bar Code and Reports plugin. Do you have documents that you wish users to read through on the screen rather than downloading them? Install the DocsViewer plugin.","title":"Questions to Ask While Planning"},{"location":"GettingStarted/Site_Planning_Tips/#plan-an-exhibit","text":"Exhibit Builder is not necessarily only for building museum-like exhibits. This function can be used to publish essays or teaching materials that draw upon the items in your archive. Before you build an exhibit, it is easier to sketch out a storyboard or outline that spells out the sections, pages, and items for each page. Each exhibit is comprised of sections that contains pages. Each page can contain a selection of items and some narrative text, or captions. Follow instructions for using the Exhibit Builder plugin.","title":"Plan an Exhibit"},{"location":"GettingStarted/Site_Planning_Tips/#create-simple-web-pages","text":"You may wish to use the Simple Pages plugin to create simple web pages for publishing an essay or to create an About or Credits page, or use it to link out to Teacher Resources.

If you want to use Omeka Classic in a language other than English, you will need to configure it in the /application/config/config.ini file. See Configuring Language for details. The installation steps are localized, so you might want to do this before the rest of the installation steps below. It is fine to change this after your site is successfully installed. Create a MySQL database on your web host, as well as a user with permissions to modify the database. Make sure to take note of the database hostname, the database name, the database user's username, and the database user's password. Make sure the collation of your database is set to 'utf8_unicode_ci' and that the charset is 'utf8'. Download the latest version of Omeka and uncompress the .zip file. The .zip file will have a name similar to 'omeka.zip' that includes the version number. Save the .zip file somewhere you can find it again, such as your Download folder. Double-click the .zip file to extract the files in the .zip archive, and make sure to note where the files are extracted. If you are unable to extract the files, you might need to download an uncompression program such as WinZip or WinRAR (for Windows)or Stuffit Expander (for Mac). The extracted (uncompressed) directory will have a name similar to 'omeka' that includes the version number. Users familiar with git might want to clone the code from our public GitHub repository . In the resulting directory, find and open your database configuration file, which is named db.ini . Replace the 'XXXXX' values in the db.ini file with your database host, username, password, and database name. You can edit the db.ini file with a text editor such as Notepad for Windows or TextEdit for Mac. Be sure to save the file as plain text and keep the name db.ini . You do not need to change values for prefix and port in the db.ini file. See the page for the Database Configuration File for an explanation of each element in the db.ini file. Upload the directory and all of its contents, including the updated db.ini file, to your server. If you have command-line access to your server, you can upload the Omeka .zip file and unzip it on the server. If you do not have command-line access to your server, you can use a file transfer program such as Filezilla or FireFTP to transfer the contents of the unzipped omeka directory to your server. This may take 20 minutes or more. Make sure to upload the .htaccess file that's in the top-level directory of the Omeka zip along with the rest of the files. This file is hidden by default in many file transfer programs; to see the .htaccess file, you may need to change the preferences in your file transfer program. You can rename the omeka directory either before or after you upload it to give it a URL that is relevant to your project. Make Omeka's storage directory and its sub-directories writable by the web server. For Omeka 1.5.3, the directory is archive . For Omeka 2.0+, the directory is files . You can change the permissions yourself with an FTP or other file transfer program, or with shell commands over SSH. If you're not sure what to do, ask your host for advice, or to change the permissions for you. Open your web browser and visit the URL where you uploaded the omeka directory. Click \"Install\". If you renamed the omeka directory 'project' and put it in the top-most directory of your site, for instance, the URL to visit would be http://mydomain.org/project . Complete the installation form by filling out the required fields, including the name of your Omeka site, email address, and username/password of the super user (the super user account controls the entire website). You can change these settings in General Settings once the installation is complete. You can leave fields that are already filled in as they are; you do not need to change the values. If the installation was successful, you'll see a screen with links to view the live site or to log in with the superuser's username and password to the administrative panel at http://mydomain.org/admin .

If your installation was unsuccessful, try these steps: Make sure that both .htaccess files mentioned above (only the top-level one for Omeka 1.4 and higher) were successfully uploaded. If both .htaccess files were successfully uploaded but your installation is still unsuccessful, make sure that the information in the 'db.ini' file on the server is correct.

The necessary process for setting permissions can differ significantly between different servers, so it's often best to get specific advice from your hosting provider. This page tries to provide some more general guidance. The user running the Omeka web process needs read , write , and execute permissions for the files directory and all its subdirectories. There are three major ways to give the needed permissions.

Each row in the file represents metadata for a single item. When using this plugin, if you plan to map to specific Item Type metadata fields, then you may only import one item type (document, still image, sound, et al) at a time. You may perform multiple imports. The plugin has the following features: File importing: If you specify permanent file URLs in a column, the importer will download and attach a file to each created item. NB: file import only works for files hosted and publicly available online; you cannot import files from a local source (ie, your computer) or from a password-protected location. Tag imports: You may include tags in your CSV file and those words will be imported as tags. Undo Imports: The Undo option lets you delete all the files added in an import. Set custom delimiters: you now have the option to set separate delimiters for columns, files, tags, and elements. Preparing for CSV Import \uf0c1 The best option is usually to use spreadsheet software (Excel, Google Sheets, Numbers) to create and organize your data. Both of these programs can export a spreadsheet into CSV format, and will handle all the necessary escaping and quoting for you. However, if you're creating or editing your data by hand, there are a few things to keep in mind: You will need to normalize your data before importing. Check to be sure that the first row of your CSV file contains column names, and that every row has the same number of columns. Check to see if any of the text contains commas, and if it does surround that segment with double-quotes. Many spreadsheet programs will do this for you automatically. If you are using a spreadsheet program, check the CSV that is exported by opening it in a plain text editor to see if the double-quotes are being added automatically. You can specify a unique delimiter for columns, files, tags, and elements. Once you do, be sure to be consistent in formatting. Remember, every row represents one item, and all items in the file must be the same item type. Look over the Dublin Core and Item Type metadata to be sure you can easily map the fields in your CSV file to the Omeka installation. Make any modifications in fields or types as necessary. It is possible to import files housed in a digital repository by adding the URL to that specific file in a column representing a file. You may import more than one file per item, by comma separating the urls within a cell. You must use a permanent link for this step. Importing \uf0c1 A quick note about CSV formats and importing: The column delimiter is the basic building block of the CSV file, and it is a comma by default. Each of the remaining delimiter inputs simply accepts a character that's used to separate multiple values within one \"cell\" of the CSV. If you are placing multiple values in single cells, the character you're using to separate those values is the delimiter. The plugin allows you to specify different delimiters for cells that contain tags, links to files, or normal element data. To import, go to the CSV Import tab in the left navigation bar in the admin Dashboard. Step 1: Select File and Item Settings Select a CSV file from your computer using the Choose File button. If using an export from an Omeka CSV report, click the next checkbox, which will override all of the following options. You can use Automap Column Names to Elements if you have formatted your column names as follows: \"Element Set Name:Element Name\", for example Dublin Core:Title . Select Item Type of the sheet to be imported. NB you can only import one item type at a time. You can also Select Collection to which to add the imported items. There are two checkboxes to make all of the imported items Public and/or Featured The next four fields are for those who are not using a standard csv for their data: If you are not using commas to separate your columns, enter the character you are using instead in the Choose Column Delimiter . Note: You may not use a tab or an empty space. If you have used a character other than a comma to separate tags within individual cells in your CSV file, you must indicate that in the Choose Tag Delimiter field. Note: You may not use a tab or an empty space. If you have used a character other than a comma to separate multiple URLs within a cell (if you are importing items from an outside repository, for example), indicate that in the Choose File Delimiter field. Note: You may not use a tab or an empty space. If any of your metadata fields has more than one element (if your item has more than one creator, for example), please tell the plugin what character you used to separate the elements. If you have more than one element in a a field but leave this blank, the plugin will treat the entire text block as one element. Note: You may not use a tab or an empty space. Click the Next button once you have filled out the above options to your satisfaction. Step 2: Map Columns to Elements, Tags, or Files On this next screen, you will see a table which includes each of the Dublin Core fields in Omeka, the text from your CSV file that is designated for that field. The \"Example from CSV file\" column in the table shows the data from the first row of data in your CSV, after the column headings. For each row in the table (which corresponds to a column in your original CSV) you have the following options: Map to Element : Select an element (all of your element sets should be represented) to which to map the column. Click the Use HTML checkbox if this data includes HTML markup. Click the Tags? checkbox (and do not map to an element) to map this data as tags Click the Files? to map this data as a file import. Click the Import CSV File button to complete the import. You may check on the progress of your import using the Status tab. Undo an Import \uf0c1 To undo an import: Click on the CSV Import administrative tab. Click the Status tab. Click the Undo link for the Import you want to undo. This will delete all items for this import. If your import hangs without completing for an extended period but the link to undo the import does not appear, you can enter the link directly into your browser address bar according to the following example: http://yourinstallurl/admin/csv-import/index/undo-import/id/idnumberforimport For example, if your Omeka instance was at the root of example.com and this was your 3rd CSV import, you would use http://example.com/admin/csv-import/index/undo-import/id/3 . You can hover over the links for previous or subsequent imports to deduce the Import ID. Troubleshooting \uf0c1 If you are having trouble with a CSV consistently not importing, try checking for these common issues: Are your jobs starting and not completing? You might need to set the path for PHP so that your system can perform the background process to make the items. Are your file links readable? Try copying and pasting them into the address bar of a browser to see if the link resolves with a file. If it does not, then that may be the issue. Check the encoding on your CSV file.

Contributors may share and upload content anonymously, and their information will only be available to site administrators. All contributions are private by default and require a site administrator to review and make them public on the Omeka site. The plugin can also automatically add a reCAPTCHA box at the bottom of each form to prevent spam-bots from spamming your website. Contribution also offers options for users to create guest accounts that make it easier for one user to submit multiple items. Other plugins can be integrated into the Contribution form, such as Simple Vocab for creating dropdown menu choices, and Geolocation for inviting users to map their submissions or locations. Installing and configuring the Contribution plugin requires a few steps. Please read through the documentation carefully. Watching the screencast we created for using and configuring this addon can be helpful as you think through each step. - please note that the screencast is version 3.0.1 and not the most current version of the plugin. An Omeka site with the Contribution plugin requires you to upload and install two separate plugins: Guest User (required) Contribution (required) If you want to collect any information from your contributors, install these two additional plugins: Record Relations (optional, only required for collecting user information) User Profiles (optional, only required for collecting user information) Screencast \uf0c1 Contribution is a somewhat complex plugin to set up. In addition to the written instructions below, please see the screencast on this plugin and Guest User . Note that there is also a screencast for the User Profiles plugin. Installing \uf0c1 Note You must upload and install the Guest User plugin before installing and activating Contribution! If you have uploaded the other plugins first, you will see in the plugin directory that you cannot install other Contribution-related plugins until Guest User is installed first. Guest User Configuration \uf0c1 After installing the plugin, click the Configure button. For more information go to the Guest User documentation . Installing Contribution \uf0c1 Upload and install the Contribution plugin in the plugin directory. Contribution settings: A new tab will appear in the left side navigation bar labeled, \u201cContribution.\u201d Click on Contribution to configure the form and submission settings. Note: a link to the contribution form will automatically be added to the site\u2019s navigation. If you wish you draft the form first, go to the site\u2019s Appearance tab at the top of the Dashboard and click on Navigation. Uncheck the \u201cContribute an Item\u201d link. At this point you can edit the label, or do that later. Setting up Contribution \uf0c1 Contribution is managed from the plugin's tab on the left-hand navigation of the admin dashboard. The Contribution section has four tabs: Getting Started, Contribution Types, Submission Settings, and Contributions. Getting Started \uf0c1 The Getting Started tab offers instructions for setting up for the form and submission settings. Contribution Types \uf0c1 The Contribution Types tab is where you choose what type of items users can share through this form (still image, audio, video, document/story, etc), and what information you want to capture about these items. The tab has a table with a row for each type. Every row shows: the type's name (the label you give it); its type (corresponding Item Type from your Omeka install); the number of Contributed Items (which also acts as link to those items); whether File Upload is allowed, disallowed, or required; and an Edit button. Click Edit to add or change data collection for a specific type. Click Add to create a new type to collect. On the Add/Edit screen for Contribution Types, there are fields for the display name and form upload, and a series of element inputs for the data you will collect from contributors. Options are: Display Name is the label for the contribution type - how it will appear on the public side. If left blank, the form will use the Item Type name. Allow File Upload Via Form lets you decide whether to allow, require, or disallow file upload. If this is set to \"required,\" users will not be able to submit the contribution form without attaching a file. Elements: each element appears as a block. The block is labeled with the Dublin Core field name Prompt is what appears on the form. Use this field to ask question or describe what you seek from users, ie, \"Share your story\" or \"When did you take this photograph?\" The Multiple Rows checkbox sets whether the entry field on the form has a single row (indicating a short answer) or allows for multiple rows (making it easier for contributors to write paragraphs of text). To add an element (question) to the contribution form: Go \"Add Element\". Select an element from the dropdown list (this includes all the Dublin Core fields as well as all Item Type elements.) Type a prompt or question in the Prompt field. If you want contributors to be able to enter longer blocks of text, click the Multiple rows checkbox. Save changes. You can edit any element's prompt or multiple row setting at any time. To delete an element, click the X button in the right corner of the block and save changes. If you accidentally click the delete button, you can click again (the X changes to an undo arrow) to restore the block. In the above image, the upper block has marked for deletion - note that the header for the block is highlighted in red. The lower block is the add element block option with the dropdown open. If you want users to select from a drop-down instead of entering text, use Simple Vocab to set up a controlled vocabulary for the element which will be applied on the admin side when adding/editing an item and in contribution forms. If you want users to be able to assign a location to their contributions, use the Geolocation plugin and check the add map to contribution form in its configuration settings. Submission Settings \uf0c1 This tab is where you set the contribution options for your form, including an option for user anonymity, and provide the text for the email confirmations sent to contributors. Contribution Slug: customize the end of the url for the contribution form ( youromekasite.net/slug ). If you leave this blank, the url for the contribution form will be youromekasite.net/contribution Email settings Contribution Confirmation Email: An email message will be sent to each contributor from this address confirming that they submitted a contribution to this website. Leave blank if you do not want an email sent. New Contribution Notification Emails: Add emails to which you want a notification sent when new contributions are received. You can enter multiple email addresses, separated by a comma. Terms of Service field Paste in text of language of consent for anyone contributing to the site, or make a short statement linking to a Simple Page with a longer terms of service statement. Note that this field allows for text formatting, including basic html and lists. Contributor anonymity settings These two checkboxes allow an Administrator to set the user requirements for submitting contributions. These settings work together to permit varying levels of anonymity for your contributors. For instance, you may require users to sign up and have an approved account before contributing, or you may require them to provide an email before contributing, or you may permit completely anonymous contributions. Allow Non-Registered Contributions requires that contributors only provide an email address. Select this option if you have set up the Guest User plugin enabling \u201cinstant access.\u201d These contributors will get an email that allows them the option of creating a password for their user account. Allow Anonymous Contributions makes it possible for users to make contributions without providing any personal data (no email address). This option can only be used if Allow non-registered contributions is checked. You cannot allow anonymous contributions without allowing non-registered contributions. The boxes work together as follows: No boxes checked: site visitors have to create a Guest User and wait for their account to be approved before they can make contributions to the site. \"Allow non-registered\" checked: visitors can make a contribution without creating a Guest User account but must provide an email address; they then have the option of completing registration by creating a password. They can also create an account as above. Both \"Allow non-registered\" and \"Allow anonymous\": visitors can still create accounts or just provide an email, but they have the option to contribute items completely anonymously, without providing an email address or any other identifying information. Additional Settings Email text to send to contributors : the text of the email sent to contributors when they contribute an item. Contribution Collection : If you want, you can specify a collection to which all new contributed items will be added (note that you must create the collection before you can select it from this dropdown). Default Contribution Type : If you select a type, it will automatically load when someone navigates to the public contribution form. If User Profiles is installed If you\u2019re collecting user data with the User Profiles plugin, you must select which profile to make available for your contribution users. See below for more information about creating a user profile. Remember to save changes. Older versions \uf0c1 If you are running Contribution versions 3.0.3 or lower, the required Contributor user data settings will be a single checkbox instead of two: Use 'Simple' Options : requires that contributors only provide an email address. Select this option if you have set up the Guest User plugin enabling \u201cinstant access.\u201d The Simple Options are equivalent to selecting \"Allow non-registered contributions\" but not \"Allow anonymous contributions\" on newer versions of the plugin. Contributions \uf0c1 This tab is where you manage and view all submissions. From this screen, it is possible to review and make items public or change their status. All contributions through the form will also be visible to browse and search on from the Items tab in your Omeka site. Collecting Information from Contributors (optional) \uf0c1 To ask for additional information about your contributors, you will need to install 2 additional plugins. If you do not wish to collect contributor information, you do not need to install Record Relations or User Profiles to use Contribution. Upload and install the Record Relations plugin Upload and install the User Profiles plugin . Once Record Relations is installed, the User Profiles plugin will become available to install. Follow directions for creating user profiles in that plugin's documentation. Adding Contribution link to Site Navigation \uf0c1 A link to the contribution form is automatically added to the main site navigation. Go to the site\u2019s Appearance tab at the top of the Dashboard and click on Navigation. You may rename the public link to the Contribution form, the default label is \u201cContribute an Item.\u201d Drag and drop the links if you wish to re-order the navigational elements of your site. Vetting and Managing Contributions \uf0c1 All new contributions will be private, and by default will be marked as \u201cNeeds Review.\u201d To review, go to the Contributed Items tab in the left navigation (once you start collecting, this tab changes name from Contribution to Contributed Items). Go to the Contributions tab and browse contributions. You may filter by status to see what Needs Review. Any item you wish to approve, you must make public and save changes. Users have the option to contribute an item that they do not wish to be made public. You will not be able to override this request from the user, so you cannot make those items \"public.\" These items will have the phrase \"private contribution\" instead of a checkbox in the first column of the contributed items table. Contributors can also make their contributions anonymously. In that case, contributor information is only visible to site administrators. Upgrading from 1.x to 2.x \uf0c1 Be sure to make a copy of the plugin\u2019s files and a backup copy of the database before upgrading. Follow upgrading process for all Omeka sites . Upload and install the following plugins, following all of the steps above for installing plugins and configuring the form above. Guest User Contribution Record Relations User Profiles If you have asked Contributor Questions on 1.5 form, go to User Profiles plugin page. Locate the check box asking if you want to import Contributor settings: check the box and save changes. Contributor pages should be linked to a Contributor\u2019s profile, and the questions you asked before should be available in the User Profile.

Exhibits are composed of pages, generally an initial page that introduces your exhibit and subsequent pages composed of the items from your Omeka Classic database that you wish to highlight and/or relate to each other. Exhibit Builder exhibits may be as short as one page or consist of multiple pages. You can make the pages of an exhibit hierarchical. The layout of exhibits in Exhibit Builder is highly customizable, with the pages composed of smaller units called blocks. There are four basic content block types which come with Exhibit Builder: file with text, gallery, text, and file. Other plugins may include their own Exhibit Builder block layouts, if the developer has created them. Configuring \uf0c1 This plugin is included in your downloaded Omeka Classic installation and does not require a separate download. Select Plugins in the top navigation of your admin. Activate your plugin and select Configure to choose the sequence in which your exhibits appear. Exhibits may be ordered by date added, alphabetically by name, or most recent. Choose the order of your Browse Page Exhibit display from the dropdown menu. Don't forget to save your changes. Getting Started \uf0c1 Once you have activated and configured the Exhibit Builder plugin, Exhibits should appear in the left navigation bar. Clicking on it will take you to the Browse Exhibits page (admin/exhibits in your installation). To create an exhibit, go to the Exhibits tab and click the green button labeled \"Add an Exhibit\". On the Add Exhibit page, enter the following metadata: Title: the name of your exhibit, which will be displayed to users Slug: the abbreviated exhibit name which appears in the url, for example http://youromekasite/exhibits/show/slug Credits: acknowledgements which will be visible to the public Description: an introduction or overview for the exhibit Tags: keywords or themes that give users another option for finding exhibits. Once you have entered the data, click Save Changes to create your exhibit. There is an option to select a theme for the exhibit (see below). The Use summary page checkbox allows you to decide whether or not to use a summary page. An exhibit summary page displays the exhibit description and navigation options. If this box is unchecked, users navigating to the exhibit will start on the first page of the exhibit. Upload a cover image to represent the exhibit on browse pages and elsewhere on your site. Theme \uf0c1 By default, your exhibits will display using the same theme as the rest of the site. You may choose a different theme for each exhibit. To do so, select a theme from the dropdown, which will default display \"Current Public Theme.\" If you select an option other than \"Current Public Theme\" for your exhibit, you can configure the theme settings for the exhibit by clicking the Configure button which will appear next to the dropdown. After selecting a specific theme for exhibit, you can configure that theme by adding a logo, header image, footer text, and copyright information which displays only for that exhibit. Note that if you change the theme, you must click Save Changes before you configure the theme. So if you have been using Berlin and you want to change to the Winter version of Seasons, you will have to click Save Changes after switching from Berlin to Seasons in the Theme dropdown before you can configure the Seasons theme. Pages \uf0c1 Once you have created an exhibit you can add pages to it by clicking the Add Page button at the bottom of the Exhibit Metadata page. Once on the Add Page screen, add the following: Page Title: visible to users, used for navigating through the exhibit. Page Slug: an abbreviated exhibit name that appears in the url, for example http://youromekasite/exhibits/show/exhibit_slug/page_slug To save the page information and continue editing that page, click the Save Changes button. To save the basic information for that page and add another page, click the Save and Add Another Page button. Organizing Pages \uf0c1 An exhibit in Omeka Classic can have multiple pages. You can reorder these pages by dragging and dropping, and you can use drag and drop to set up an exhibit page hierarchy. Note that these hierarchies cannot be more than three levels deep. You can also delete pages from the Exhibit Metadata page through a two-step process. First, click the large black X on the display bar of the page you wish to delete. Once you click the X, the bar will turn red (see the bar for the page Edward in the image below). Clicking the arrow will undo the delete action. To confirm deleting a page, you must click the Save Changes button. Once pages have been deleted, they cannot be restored. Content \uf0c1 Pages are made up of combinations of smaller content units called 'blocks.' There are four basic kinds of blocks: item(s) with text, an item gallery, text only, and file only. Each page can have one or more content blocks. The File with Text block allows you to pair fullsize or thumbnail files of your items with a block of text. The item files will all be the same size. Text will appear either to the right or left of the item(s). You can use a single item file paired with text, or have multiple item files to the right or left of a block of text. The Gallery block creates a gallery of item files, generally large square thumbnails. You can add text to the gallery, which will display left or right of the gallery. In a gallery block, you can specify a showcase file, which will appear fullsize either to the right or left of the text. The other gallery images can be placed below the showcase image or beside it, over the text. The Text block allows you to create a section of text which spans the width of the entire page. The File block allows you to add larger files as a separate block. To add a content block, select the layout you want in the New Block dialog box. Once you have selected the kind you want, click the \"Add new content block\" button. You will have a new block on the page to configure your content. Some plugins, such as Geolocation and Exhibit Image Annotation will create additional block types which you can select when building a page. Adding Items \uf0c1 If you have selected any block other than Text, choose an item by clicking the large plus sign button titled Add Item appearing in the Items area. An items browse dialog box pops up showing all of your items. You can browse using the back and forth arrow buttons in the upper right corner of the dialog box. Clicking Show Search Form will take you to an advanced item search. To select an item, click on the bar representing it in the Attach an Item window. The right end of the bar will highlight a dark brown \"Select Item\" button. Click Select Item to find options for selecting a file and creating a caption for the item. If you have more than one file uploaded for an item, you will be able to select which you want to use by clicking on it. Add a caption in the text field. This will appear in smaller font below the file, not as part of a larger text block. Best practice is to keep it short. Click Apply to add the item to the block. Click the X in the upper right corner of the Attach an Item window at any time to exit the process. Once you have added an item, you can change the caption or selected file by clicking the edit button which sits across the bottom of the item icon. To add multiple files from the same item, simply add the same item to the block, choosing a different file to represent the item each time. To delete items, click the x in the upper right hand corner of the item icon; this will gray out the icon, indicating that it will be deleted the next time you save changes. If you decide not to delete the item, you can click the curved arrow which replaced the x, but you must do so before you save your changes. In the image below, the middle item has been marked for deletion. A red arrow points to the X to delete the third item. Exhibit text can be formatted using the text editor bar . To write your own html, or paste from somewhere else, click the blue HTML button in the formatting toolbar at the top of the text entry box. This will open up an HTML Source Editor window in which you can work. Layout Options \uf0c1 Both the File with Text and Gallery blocks include layout options to change the look of the exhibit page. To access these options, click the black triangle button to the right of the Layout Options text at the bottom of the block. This will reveal dropdown menus with options for changing the layout. The File with Text block has the following options, all of which are drop-down menus (options listed in parentheses after the dropdown label): File Position (left, right): position of the file relative to the text block. File Size (full-size, thumbnail, square thumbnail): Captions position (center, left, right): the position of the file's caption relative to the file (not the text block) Whatever you select affects all of the files for that block equally. The text in this block will stay fixed to the right or left of the file, but will wrap below if the length of the text exceeds the height of the file. The Gallery block has the following options, all of which are drop-down menus (options listed in parentheses after the dropdown label): Showcase File Position (no showcase file, left, right): a showcase file is full-size, while the rest of the gallery files are thumbnails. Gallery position (left, right): position of the gallery files relative to the showcase file. If there is no showcase file, the gallery will use the full width of the page. Gallery File Size (square thumbnail, thumbnail): for all files in the gallery except the showcase file. Captions Position (center, left, right): the position of the file's caption relative to its file. The File block has the following options, all of which are drop-down menus (options listed in parentheses after the dropdown label): File Position (left, right, center): position of the file relative to page margins. File Size (full-size, thumbnail, square thumbnail): Captions position (center, left, right): the position of the file's caption relative to page margins (not the file) Additional Layouts \uf0c1 Some plugins include their own Exhibit Builder content block layouts. If you have installed the Geolocation plugin, you will have the Geolocation Map block as an option in your exhibits. This block has no text. Select items which already have been geolocated using the plugin in their item edit page. This block displays as a map across the full width of the page, with markers for the items you select. Any captions you enter will appear in a pop-up inside the map when the item marker is clicked, as will the item file and title. This image shows a Geolocation block with items added: And this is how the map looks on the public view of the exhibit page: Shortcodes \uf0c1 Exhibit Builder adds specific shortcodes to your instal which allow you to call specific exhibits or featured exhibits. See the plugin shortcodes documentation for more information. Previous Exhibit Builder Layouts \uf0c1 The following is a list of layouts from previous versions of Exhibit Builder showing how the old layouts can correspond to new content blocks. These correlations are how pages built in previous versions of Exhibit Builder will be imported when upgrading. Although it is possible to reproduce previous layouts using Exhibit Builder 3.0, the content blocks allow for a much wider variety of layouts. For example, rather than having all the files on one side, as in image list left or right, files could alternate sides. You can also combine a Gallery block with File with Text Blocks, or stack multiple Galleries with interpretive text for each set. NB: You cannot change one kind content block (ex. Gallery) to a different kind of content block (ex. File with Text). However, because you can move content blocks around, adding a new block to replace an existing one is less work than in previous versions of Exhibit Builder. Block layout options are in italics for Exhibit Builder 3.0 blocks.

Exhibits are composed of pages, generally an initial page that introduces your exhibit and subsequent pages composed of the items from your Omeka Classic database that you wish to highlight and/or relate to each other. Exhibit Builder exhibits may be as short as one page or consist of multiple pages. You can make the pages of an exhibit hierarchical. The layout of exhibits in Exhibit Builder is highly customizable, with the pages composed of smaller units called blocks. There are four basic content block types which come with Exhibit Builder: file with text, gallery, text, and file. Other plugins may include their own Exhibit Builder block layouts, if the developer has created them.","title":"Exhibit Builder"},{"location":"Plugins/ExhibitBuilder/#configuring","text":"This plugin is included in your downloaded Omeka Classic installation and does not require a separate download. Select Plugins in the top navigation of your admin. Activate your plugin and select Configure to choose the sequence in which your exhibits appear.

Don't forget to save your changes.","title":"Configuring"},{"location":"Plugins/ExhibitBuilder/#getting-started","text":"Once you have activated and configured the Exhibit Builder plugin, Exhibits should appear in the left navigation bar. Clicking on it will take you to the Browse Exhibits page (admin/exhibits in your installation). To create an exhibit, go to the Exhibits tab and click the green button labeled \"Add an Exhibit\". On the Add Exhibit page, enter the following metadata: Title: the name of your exhibit, which will be displayed to users Slug: the abbreviated exhibit name which appears in the url, for example http://youromekasite/exhibits/show/slug Credits: acknowledgements which will be visible to the public Description: an introduction or overview for the exhibit Tags: keywords or themes that give users another option for finding exhibits. Once you have entered the data, click Save Changes to create your exhibit. There is an option to select a theme for the exhibit (see below). The Use summary page checkbox allows you to decide whether or not to use a summary page. An exhibit summary page displays the exhibit description and navigation options. If this box is unchecked, users navigating to the exhibit will start on the first page of the exhibit. Upload a cover image to represent the exhibit on browse pages and elsewhere on your site.","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"Plugins/ExhibitBuilder/#theme","text":"By default, your exhibits will display using the same theme as the rest of the site. You may choose a different theme for each exhibit. To do so, select a theme from the dropdown, which will default display \"Current Public Theme.\" If you select an option other than \"Current Public Theme\" for your exhibit, you can configure the theme settings for the exhibit by clicking the Configure button which will appear next to the dropdown. After selecting a specific theme for exhibit, you can configure that theme by adding a logo, header image, footer text, and copyright information which displays only for that exhibit. Note that if you change the theme, you must click Save Changes before you configure the theme. So if you have been using Berlin and you want to change to the Winter version of Seasons, you will have to click Save Changes after switching from Berlin to Seasons in the Theme dropdown before you can configure the Seasons theme.","title":"Theme"},{"location":"Plugins/ExhibitBuilder/#pages","text":"Once you have created an exhibit you can add pages to it by clicking the Add Page button at the bottom of the Exhibit Metadata page.

You can reorder these pages by dragging and dropping, and you can use drag and drop to set up an exhibit page hierarchy. Note that these hierarchies cannot be more than three levels deep. You can also delete pages from the Exhibit Metadata page through a two-step process. First, click the large black X on the display bar of the page you wish to delete. Once you click the X, the bar will turn red (see the bar for the page Edward in the image below). Clicking the arrow will undo the delete action. To confirm deleting a page, you must click the Save Changes button. Once pages have been deleted, they cannot be restored.","title":"Organizing Pages"},{"location":"Plugins/ExhibitBuilder/#content","text":"Pages are made up of combinations of smaller content units called 'blocks.' There are four basic kinds of blocks: item(s) with text, an item gallery, text only, and file only. Each page can have one or more content blocks. The File with Text block allows you to pair fullsize or thumbnail files of your items with a block of text. The item files will all be the same size. Text will appear either to the right or left of the item(s). You can use a single item file paired with text, or have multiple item files to the right or left of a block of text. The Gallery block creates a gallery of item files, generally large square thumbnails. You can add text to the gallery, which will display left or right of the gallery. In a gallery block, you can specify a showcase file, which will appear fullsize either to the right or left of the text. The other gallery images can be placed below the showcase image or beside it, over the text. The Text block allows you to create a section of text which spans the width of the entire page. The File block allows you to add larger files as a separate block. To add a content block, select the layout you want in the New Block dialog box. Once you have selected the kind you want, click the \"Add new content block\" button. You will have a new block on the page to configure your content. Some plugins, such as Geolocation and Exhibit Image Annotation will create additional block types which you can select when building a page.","title":"Content"},{"location":"Plugins/ExhibitBuilder/#adding-items","text":"If you have selected any block other than Text, choose an item by clicking the large plus sign button titled Add Item appearing in the Items area. An items browse dialog box pops up showing all of your items. You can browse using the back and forth arrow buttons in the upper right corner of the dialog box. Clicking Show Search Form will take you to an advanced item search. To select an item, click on the bar representing it in the Attach an Item window. The right end of the bar will highlight a dark brown \"Select Item\" button. Click Select Item to find options for selecting a file and creating a caption for the item. If you have more than one file uploaded for an item, you will be able to select which you want to use by clicking on it. Add a caption in the text field. This will appear in smaller font below the file, not as part of a larger text block. Best practice is to keep it short. Click Apply to add the item to the block. Click the X in the upper right corner of the Attach an Item window at any time to exit the process. Once you have added an item, you can change the caption or selected file by clicking the edit button which sits across the bottom of the item icon. To add multiple files from the same item, simply add the same item to the block, choosing a different file to represent the item each time. To delete items, click the x in the upper right hand corner of the item icon; this will gray out the icon, indicating that it will be deleted the next time you save changes. If you decide not to delete the item, you can click the curved arrow which replaced the x, but you must do so before you save your changes. In the image below, the middle item has been marked for deletion. A red arrow points to the X to delete the third item. Exhibit text can be formatted using the text editor bar . To write your own html, or paste from somewhere else, click the blue HTML button in the formatting toolbar at the top of the text entry box.

The locations are displayed on maps on individual items page and on a browsable map of all geolocated items. There is a screencast for Geolocation (version 2.2.4) demonstrating its basic functionality. Configuring \uf0c1 Once you have installed the Geolocation plugin, go to the Plugins tab in the top navigation of your admin dashboard. Scroll down to the listing for Geolocation and click Configure (if you do not see Configure you may need to click the Install or Activate buttons. General Settings \uf0c1 The first section for configuration are the general settings for the appearance of your map on the public and admin sides of your site. Default latitude : set the center point of the map's latitude (North/South value), in degrees. Using numbers after the decimal point will pinpoint the location more precisely. Default longitude : set the center point of the map's longitude (East/West), in degrees. Using numbers after the decimal point will pinpoint the location more precisely. Default Zoom Level : Use a whole number of 0 of greater. 0 is the most zoomed out. A value of 15 will result in a map showing roughly one square mile Base Map : select a map from the dropdown to serve as the base map in the display. All base maps except those served by Mapbox can be previewed courtesy of Leaflet . If you select Mapbox from the dropdown for Base Map, two additional fields will appear under general settings. Mapbox Access Token : in order to use Mapbox, you need to sign up for their service. Once you have done so, you can go to your account page and copy your access token to paste into this field. Mapbox Map ID : The \"map ID\" that goes here is the part of a Mapbox \"Style URL\" that comes after \"mapbox://styles/\". You can use your own maps or one of the globally available styles . Leaving this input blank will use the default Mapbox street map. As of June 1, 2020, Mapbox has deprecated older-style maps. Geolocation 3.2 and up support the newer Mapbox API, and the plugin will automatically update your selected Map ID if you were using one of the \"standard\" map types. If you had specified a custom map ID, you may need to update it after upgrading Geolocation. You can use MapBox to create your own map tiles, for example a historic map layer. Please refer to the MapBox documentation for more information. Browse Map Settings \uf0c1 These settings are for the map through which users can browse all geolocated items, and for the \"Search by Address function\" that Geolocation enables in advanced item search. Number of Locations Per Page : The browsable map has pagination; set the number of items per map page with a whole number. Auto-fit to Locations : If checked, the browse map will ignore default location and zoom settings designated in General Settings and instead auto fit to the locations of the items displayed (on that page) Default Radius : for the Search By Address function in the advanced items search. A checkbox to Use metric distances for radius search, rather than miles. A checkbox to Enable marker clusters . When checked, markers that are very close to each other will cluster together and be represented by a number (indicating the number of markers) A map with Enable marker clusters unchecked: The same map with Enable marker clusters checked: Item Map Settings \uf0c1 These settings are for the map display on an item/show page. Width for Item Map : set in percent, defaults to 100% if left blank. Height for Item Map : set in pixels defaults to 300px if left blank. Map Integration \uf0c1 These settings are for integration of the geolocation map into the site menu and the contribution plugin's form. Add link to map on Items/Browse navigation : click to make active. Add map to contribution form : click to make active. Note that this will only work if you have the Contribution plugin installed and active. Adding Location to an Item \uf0c1 After you have activated and configured the Geolocation plugin, you can add a location marker to your items. Note: an item can only have a single location marker; you cannot have an item associated with more than one location at a time. Geolocation adds a Map tab to the options for adding or editing an item ( admin/item/edit and admin/item/add pages). When adding metadata for an item, click on the Map tab to add a location. On the tab there is a field for you to find a location by address and a map which you can drag to move around, zoom in and out with the plus and minus options (or the scroll wheel on a mouse), and toggle between road and satellite maps. To find the location you want to assign to the item, you can: Enter the address where you want the marker for the item to be placed. The plugin will automatically add a marker at that location. You can use a street address (ex 100 First St SE, Washington, DC 20543 ) or geocordinates in decimal form (ex 38.888611, -77.004722 ). Zoom and scroll to navigate to where you want to place the marker, then click directly on the spot on the map where you want to place the marker. To change the location of an item, type in the new address or click on the new location. You'll be asked if you are sure you would like to change the item location. Select OK or Cancel. To remove geolocation from an item, click directly on the marker. A dialog box will ask you to confirm that you want to delete the location assignment. Don't forget to save your changes. Viewing Items on the Public Map \uf0c1 Visitors to your Omeka site may use a map to browse through all of your geolocated items. When configuring the plugin, if you selected \"Add Link to Map on Items/Browse Navigation,\" a \"Browse Map\" link will be added automatically to the secondary navigation on the items/browse page. From this view, visitors may browse all mapped items, browse by tag, search for items and browse the map. They may also locate a mapped item by clicking on the items listed in the right column of the map. Browse and Search Items on Admin Map \uf0c1 A Map tab appears in the left navigation bar located on the left side of the Dashboard. Clicking on the Map tab takes you to a map that displays all items geolocated in your Omeka site--public and not public, and an advanced search form to locate specific items. From this view, you may also search mapped items using the item advanced search. Search results appear directly on the map. Geolocation and Exhibit Builder \uf0c1 If you have Exhibit Builder (version 3.x) installed, Geolocation will add a Map block to the options when building pages. You can add items with geolocation markers to the map block by adding items as you would with any other Exhibit Builder block. Only items to which you have added a location will show up on the map; the map will ignore items without a location. The exhibit will display a single map with the markers for those specific items, centered to display all the items within the map view. Shortcodes \uf0c1 The geolocation shortcode will create a map of items based on parameters it is given. The shortcode is [geolocation] . Without any additional parameters, it will return a map of all items that contain geolocation data, limited by the records per page as set in the Geolocation plugin configuration. Options fit : specify whether to allow google map to automatically center and zoom the map to fit all of the markers. This is on by default. To manually specify the map/location zoom, use the following options. Note, to use these options, fit must be set to \u20180\u2019 or \u2018false\u2019. lat : specify the latitude of the map\u2019s initial center point, in degrees. : Must be between -90 and 90. lon : specify the longitude of the map\u2019s initial center point, in degrees. : Must be between -180 and 180 zoom : specify the initial zoom level of the map. 0 is the most zoomed out. If any of lat , lon , or zoom are not specifically set, and \u2018fit\u2019 is set to 0 or false , the settings from the Geolocation plugin configuration page will be used. type : specify the type of google map that appears. Defaults to the setting from the Geolocation plugin configuration page. - roadmap - displays the road map view - satellite - displays Google Earth satellite images - hybrid - displays a mixture of road map and satellite views - terrain - displays a physical map based on terrain information collection : limits the map\u2019s items to those from a specific collection, using the collection ID number. Only one collection may be specified. : For example: [geolocation collection=5] tags : limits the map\u2019s items to those from a specific tag. Multiple tags can be entered, separated by a comma, and without any spaces. : For example: [geolocation tags=baseball,math] height : set the map height. Can be set in pixels or percentages, but requires specification with either px or %; defaults to 436px. : For example: [geolocation height=300px] or [geolocation height=50%] width : set the map width. Can be set in pixels or percentages, but requires specification with either px or %; defaults to 100%. : For example: [geolocation width=200px] or [geolocation width=75%] Examples \uf0c1 To print a map of all geotagged items, simply use: : [geolocation] For a map that gets all of the items from your first collection, that are also tagged \u2018baseball\u2019 : [geolocation collection=1 tags=baseball] A shortcode that leveraged all of the possible parameters would look like : [geolocation lat=42 lon=117 zoom=7 type=hybrid collection=4 tags=baseball,math,oakland height=500px width=500px]","title":"Geolocation"},{"location":"Plugins/Geolocation/#geolocation","text":"The Geolocation plugin allows you to assign a location to items in your Omeka Classic site.

Geolocation adds a Map tab to the options for adding or editing an item ( admin/item/edit and admin/item/add pages). When adding metadata for an item, click on the Map tab to add a location. On the tab there is a field for you to find a location by address and a map which you can drag to move around, zoom in and out with the plus and minus options (or the scroll wheel on a mouse), and toggle between road and satellite maps. To find the location you want to assign to the item, you can: Enter the address where you want the marker for the item to be placed. The plugin will automatically add a marker at that location. You can use a street address (ex 100 First St SE, Washington, DC 20543 ) or geocordinates in decimal form (ex 38.888611, -77.004722 ). Zoom and scroll to navigate to where you want to place the marker, then click directly on the spot on the map where you want to place the marker.

A corpus is generated by querying the content of a selected text element field. Corpora may then be investigated via ngram graphs, counts, and frequencies. For additional information on ngrams, please see: Benjamin M. Schmidt, \u201cWords Alone: Dismantling Topic Models in the Humanities,\u201d Journal of Digital Humanities 2, no. 1 (winter 2012). Dan Cohen, \u201cA Conversation with Data: Prospecting Victorian Words and Ideas,\u201d dancohen.org, May 30, 2012. Please note, your results will be more meaningful when you are working with clean data. Before you begin, ensure that the formatting of your data fields (in particular, those that include numeric sequences like dates) are consistent. System Requirements: The Ngram plugin requires the following libraries and dependencies: IntlBreakIterator class (in your php) Make sure your php path is properly configured. Installation and Configuration \uf0c1 Install the plugin. \uf0c1 Once you\u2019ve installed it on the server, navigate to the Plugins menu in your Omeka site and click the install button. On installation the plugin automatically creates a Ngram button in the Admin navigation and allows the plugin to be configured on the Plugins page. Configure the plugin. \uf0c1 There are two configuration features for the Ngram plugin: Text Element : a dropdown menu from which you may select one text element to create an ngram corpus. In order to produce an ngram, the plugin must be directed to a particular text element. For best results, choose a Text Element by reviewing items within your collection and identify a text field that is meaningful across multiple items. Text Elements are listed in a dropdown menu. If you have created unique metadata categories for your collection, these will also be available for selection in the dropdown. You must select a single element. This means you cannot produce ngrams from multiple text fields. For example, a user might choose to examine a collection of items with useful text in the Description field. Configuring the Text Element to the Description field directs the plugin to create a corpus that includes all items with text in that element. Items that do not have content in this text element will be ignored. Note : You may select different text elements for different corpora. However do not modify the Text Element setting while you are in the process of validating items and generating ngrams for a corpus! Doing so will break that process. Only change this once you have generated all ngrams for a corpus. Reset processes : a checkbox that will reset any ongoing processes that are hanging or showing errors. Note: be sure to click to save changes. Add a Corpus \uf0c1 Create a Corpus \uf0c1 A corpus is drawn from the items in your collection with content in a particular text element (which is selected on the plugin configuration page), it is further defined by a Search Query and Sequence elements (on the Add a Corpus page), producing an Item Pool. The Item Pool will be further refined by Validating the Items. To create a corpus and start viewing ngrams, go to the Ngram tab on the left hand navigation of your Omeka admin dashboard. On the Browse Corpora page, click the green Add a Corpus button. On the Add a Corpus page, complete the following options: Name : A field in which you must give the corpus a name. Ideally, choose something that meaningfully describes the corpora, as there are no descriptions for these corpora. Public : A check box. Click the checkbox to make the corpus visible to public users (on the public side of the site). Search Query : A field in which you refine the contents of your corpus by inputting a search query. The best way to get this search query is to perform an advanced search of the items in your collection on the Admin side of your Omeka site. Then, copy and paste the entire URL of the results, after the part that reads admin/items/browse? Sequence : Sequence Element : select from elements but it should be something with numeric or date input. Items without the selected element field filled in (for instance, an item without a Date will not be included in the corpus). For best results, ensure consistency of metadata, and select a meaningful field. Sequence type : choose from Date by Year, Date by Month, Date by Day, or Numeric Sequence Range. The field will prompt you with the proper format for the sequence if you choose a Date type. If numeric, make sure the format matches the numeric sequence of the elements you\u2019re drawing from. Note : Date should be entered in the YearMonthDay format and should be entered as a range. (for instance, 20010101-20160101) Note : You do not have to have a sequence, but without one you cannot generate graphs. Note : The Text Element box under the green Add Corpus button on the Add Corpus page. The Text Element was configured in the plugin panel. When you have completed adding your corpus, click the green Add Corpus button. Manage your Corpus \uf0c1 After you have added a corpus, the screen will update with information and options for that corpus. On the left the elements that were input on the Add Corpus screen are listed. Public Search Query Browse search results Sequence Element Sequence Range Note : Clicking browse Search Results will open a Browse Items page with all the items based on your search term. On the right, buttons allow the user to Edit and Delete the corpus and Validate Items. After you have validated items, buttons here allow you to generate unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams, and to view the corpus. Below, a small pane indicates the Text Element for the corpus. At the bottom an Item Counts pane will populate a pool of items from which this corpus may be derived. Validate Items \uf0c1 After the Corpus has been created you must validate items before you can generate ngrams and view frequencies. To do so, click the green Validate Items button on the right hand side (just below the Delete button). This will take you to a new screen with three tabs: valid items, invalid items, and out of range items. Valid items are those items with sequence text that is readable to the plugin (See Figure 1). The table on this tab gives: the item number (a link to the item), the text in the sequence element, and Sequence member, or how it will be used in sequence by the plugin (Ex. when the sequence is \u201cDate by Year\u201d and the Sequence. Invalid items have text in the sequence element which the plugin cannot parse (See Figure 2). However, you can click on the Item ID number to go in and edit the item to correct the element text. Out of range items have text in their sequence element which is outside the range you set (See Figure 3). The table on this tab gives: the item number (a link to the item), the text in the sequence element, and Sequence member, or how it will be used in sequence by the plugin (Ex. when the sequence is \u201cDate by Year\u201d and the Sequence Note : to update the sequence text in these items, utilize the linked item number to modify each item. If you do not modify out of range items, they will not be included in the corpus. For ease of navigation, you may click to open a new tab for the invalid or out of range items you would like to modify. Refresh the list of valid and invalid items by reloading this page. Once you are done correcting invalid items, or the list of valid items looks correct, click the green Accept Valid Items button. Note : Once you click the Accept Valid Items button you will not be able to reconfigure the item pool or reset the body of valid items Valid Items (Figure 1) Invalid Items (Figure 2) Out of Range Items (Figure 3) Note : After you have validated your items, the Item Counts pane will update to provide a count of the number of items in your corpus. Generate Ngrams \uf0c1 After you have validated your items, click the buttons to generate unigrams (single words), bigrams (two word pairs), and trigrams (three word groups). You can only do one at a time. Refresh the page to see if the process is complete - larger corpora will take longer to process. While the ngrams are processing, these buttons will be grey and text will update to indicate which process is \u201cIn Progress.\u201d When complete, the text will update to read \u201cGenerated.\u201d You do not have to generate unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams in order to use the View Corpus functions. However, running all three processes before you view corpus will give you more options when analyzing the corpus. Note : It is only possible to generate one corpus at a time. View Corpus \uf0c1 Once you have created a corpus, validated the items, and generated ngrams, you can view the corpus in two ways: Ngram Search and Ngram Frequency. In order to get back to the Corpus summary page from the Corpus viewer, click the \u201cback to Corpus\u201d button just under the label Corpus viewer. Ngram Search - Using the text field, enter comma-separated phrases or words to graph frequency across the corpus. Note : You can only search for two word phrases if you have generated bigrams, etc. You can, if you want, specify a range for the corpus search. Note that the format of the range you search must match exactly the format of your sequence data. So if you have sequenced the corpus by year, enter a four digit year, whereas if you have done it by month you must enter yyyymm formatted range data. The results should return a sequence graph (if they do not, check the formatting of the range data), along with a table showing Ngram Counts and Total Ngram Counts. Sequence Graph: Hovering over points on the sequence graph produces a small chart containing data that includes; time period ngram percentage of the ngram in the corpus for a particular time period. Ngram Counts: This chart includes information about the ngrams in the corpus. ngram: the phrases or words used to produce the sequence graph. n: number of words in the ngram phrase. Count: total number of that ngram in the corpus. Frequency %: percentage of the ngram in the entire corpus. Total Ngram Counts: This chart includes information about the corpus. n: the number of words/phrases in an ngram. Total Count: the number of unigrams, bigrams, trigrams in the corpus. Total Unique Count: the number of unique ngrams within the unigrams, bigrams, trigrams. Note : These results reflect the composition of the selected corpus (which has been filtered by text element and search query), not the entirety of your collection. Ngram Frequency - The Ngram Frequency Corpus view returns ngrams in order of frequency. Enter the number of results you want to return of unigram, bigrams, or trigrams (select one using the radio button). By default the number of results is set to 100. Clicking the Go button produces frequency information, including; the total number and unique number of unigrams/bigrams/trigrams, and a chart that displays the ngram, total count, and a frequency percentage. Note that the ngram plugin does not strip out stop words (a, the, of, for example) so depending on the content of the element that is forming your corpus you may want to enter a larger number in order to return useful results. Browse Corpora \uf0c1 Once you have at least one corpus, the page at admin/ngram/corpora (the ngram tab) will display a table of your corpora with the following information for each: Name (that you give it) Text Element being used as the source of the corpus data, with element set in parentheses Sequence Element , with element set in parentheses Sequence Type Sequence Range Case Studies \uf0c1 The following case studies examine the Text Analysis and Ngram plugins using data from the September 11 Digital Archive .

If you have created unique metadata categories for your collection, these will also be available for selection in the dropdown. You must select a single element. This means you cannot produce ngrams from multiple text fields. For example, a user might choose to examine a collection of items with useful text in the Description field. Configuring the Text Element to the Description field directs the plugin to create a corpus that includes all items with text in that element. Items that do not have content in this text element will be ignored. Note : You may select different text elements for different corpora. However do not modify the Text Element setting while you are in the process of validating items and generating ngrams for a corpus! Doing so will break that process.

The plugin implements version 2.0 of the protocol. This plugin is the reverse of the functionality provided by the OAI-PMH Harvester plugin . Metadata Formats \uf0c1 The plugin ships with several default formats. Other plugins can alter these or add their own (see Extending below) Dublin Core ( oai_dc ) This is required by the OAI-PMH specification for all repositories. Omeka metadata fields are mapped one-to-one with fields for this output format, and it is the preferred format to use with the plugin. CDWA Lite ( cdwalite ) The mapping between Omeka's metadata and CDWA Lite metadata is more complicated, and certain fields may not be populated correctly.The chief advantage of using CDWA Lite output is that file URLs can be output in a controlled format, unlike Dublin Core. Harvesters may therefore be able to harvest or link to files in addition to metadata. MODS ( mods ) This output crosswalks the Dublin Core metadata to MODS using the mapping recommended by the Library of Congress. METS ( mets ) The Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard exposes files to harvesters. RDF ( rdf ) This format exposes metadata as RDF/XML. Unlike many of the other formats, RDF allows the repository to expose metadata from different standards all in the same output. The main practical distinction from other formats currently is that the RDF output will automatically include \"qualified\" data from the Dublin Core Extended plugin, if it's present. Omeka XML ( omeka-xml ) This output format uses an Omeka-specific XML output that includes all metadata elements without requiring crosswalking or subsetting, but is not well-supported by harvesters or other tools. Configuration \uf0c1 When you install the plugin, you will be automatically directed to the plugin configuration page. You can access these again at any time by going to the Plugins tab of the top navigation, scrolling down to the OAI-PMH Repository plugin in the list and clicking the blue \"Configure\" button. At the top of the configuration page, the plugin displays the address for your OAH-PMH repository. Repository name : A text field where you can enter a name for this OAI-PMH repository. This value is sent as part of the response to an Identify request, and it is how the repository will be identified by harvesters. Defaults to the name of the Omeka installation. Namespace identifier : A text field to set the namespace identifier; this is required to be the domain name of the Omeka site. If your site lives in a subdirectory (yourdomain.com/omeka), it is the main domain (yourdomain.com). If it can, the plugin will try to automatically detect the domain of the server hosting the site, and use that as the default namespace identifier. If a name can't be detected (for example, if the site is accessed through the localhost domain), the default will be \"default.must.change\" and you will need to set the namespace manually. Best practice is to set this value to the domain name the Omeka server is published at, possibly with a prefix like \"oai.\" Expose files : A checkbox to set whether the repository should expose direct URLs to all the files associated with an item as part of its returned metadata. This gives harvesters the ability to directly access the files described by the metadata. Expose empty collections : A checkbox to set whether the plugin should expose empty public collections. If enabled, all public collections are included in ListSets output. If disabled, only collections that actually contain at least one public item will be included in the ListSets output. Expose item type : a checkbox to set whether the plugin should expose the item type as Dublin Core Type. When enabled, for items that belong to an item type, the repository will expose an additional Dublin Core Type element with a value of the item type's name. Note that this option will only expose the item type name , not any other item type metadata. Advanced Configuration \uf0c1 The plugin also allows you to configure some more options about how the repository responds to harvesters. Since the default values are recommended for most users, these values must be edited by hand, in the config.ini file in the plugin's root directory, accessed using an FTP or SSH client. List response limit : Number of individual items that can be returned in a response at once. Larger values will increase memory usage but reduce the number of database queries and HTTP requests. Smaller values will reduce memory usage but increase the number of DB queries and requests. Default is 50. List expiration time : The amount of time, in minutes, a resumptionToken is valid for. The specification suggests a number in the tens of minutes. This boils down to the length of time a harvester has to request the next part of an incomplete list request. Default is 10 (minutes) Extending \uf0c1 The plugin provides a filter that other plugins can use to add new metadata formats or replace the existing ones with new implementations. As of version 2.1, it's no longer necessary to add or change files within the plugin itself to change the available formats. Filter oai_pmh_repository_metadata_formats \uf0c1 The filter passes no extra parameters. The value being filtered is an array of arrays, where each inner array describes a single metadata format. The key in the outer array is the metadata prefix for the format (i.e., oai_dc or rdf ).

Some online repositories expose their metadata through the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH). This plugin makes it possible to harvest that metadata, mapping it to the Omeka data model. The plugin can be used for one-time data transfers, or to keep up-to-date with changes to an online repository. Currently the plugin is able to import Dublin Core , CDWA Lite metadata, and METS . Dublin Core is an internationally recognized standard for describing any resource. Every OAI-PMH data provider should implement this standard. CDWA Lite is a standard for describing works of art and material culture. Very few repositories expose CDWA Lite, but the standard is getting more and more popular. METS is developed as an initiative of the Digital Library Federation and maintained in the Network Development and MARC Standards Office of the Library of Congress. Installation \uf0c1 Your server must have PHP-CLI installed. Upload and install the OAI-PMH Harvester plugin. Instructions \uf0c1 Performing a harvest \uf0c1 To perform a harvest, go to the OAI-PMH Harvester tab in the left-hand navigation bar. Enter an OAI-PMH base URL, click \"View Sets\" Not all repository utilize METS. However, if you are accessing a repository utilizing a mets metadata library, you will be given the choice to harvest either oai-dc or mets. Select the type of data you will harvest from the dropdown menu. To harvest the entire repository, select Go. To harvest single sets within a repository, select the type of data you are harvesting from an individual set, mets or oai-dc (if the choice exists) and select the Go link associated with that set. The harvest process runs in the background and may take a while. Go to the harvest's \"Status\" page to check the progress If you encounter errors, submit the base URL and status messages to the Omeka forums Re-harvesting and updating \uf0c1 The harvester includes the ability to make multiple successive harvests from a single repository, keeping in sync with changes to that repository. After a repository or set has been successfully harvested, a \"Re-harvest\" button will be added to its entry on the OAI-PMH Harvester page. Clicking this button will harvest from that repository again using all the same settings, adding new items and updating previously-harvested items as necessary. Manually specifying the exact same harvest to be run again (same base URL, set, and metadata prefix) will result in the same behavior. Duplicate items \uf0c1 Duplicate items (multiple Omeka items corresponding to the same repository record) can be created if an item in a repository is a member of several OAI-PMH sets. This will also occur if a repository is harvested using more than one metadata prefix. In this case, the duplicate items are independent, and changes to one will not propagate to the others. However, the duplicate items, if any, can be accessed from the admin item show page. If an item has duplicates, they will be shown in an infobox on the right-hand side of the page titled \"Duplicate Harvested Items.\" Delete Harvest \uf0c1 It is possible to undo a harvest, deleting all imported items. To do so: Click on the OAI-PMH Harvester in the left hand navigation of your admin dashboard. There will be a table of completed and in-progress Harvests; the far right column is Status. Click on the status (Completed) of the harvest you wish to undo. Do not click the green re-harvest button. The next page will give you a report on the harvest.

This plugin makes it possible to harvest that metadata, mapping it to the Omeka data model. The plugin can be used for one-time data transfers, or to keep up-to-date with changes to an online repository. Currently the plugin is able to import Dublin Core , CDWA Lite metadata, and METS . Dublin Core is an internationally recognized standard for describing any resource. Every OAI-PMH data provider should implement this standard. CDWA Lite is a standard for describing works of art and material culture. Very few repositories expose CDWA Lite, but the standard is getting more and more popular.

Multiple imports from the same origin site will update the data, not create new items. Requirements \uf0c1 Omeka API Import requires Omeka Classic 2.0 or higher for the target site. The origin site must have Omeka Classic 2.1 or higher. The origin Omeka Classic installation does not need to have the Omeka API Import plugin installed, but it does need to have the API activated . To do this, the owner of the origin Omeka Classic installation should go to the API tab under Settings, accessed via the top navigation bar on the administrative dashboard. Ensure that the \u201cEnable API\u201d box is checked. To find the API url of the origin Omeka Classic installation, go to the home page of that installation. Add /api to the end of the url. You should see a page with the message \"This is the endpoint URL for [name of origin site]\" and links to the site information and available API resources. To confirm that the API is enabled, click on the link for available API resources; if you see {\"message\":\"API is disabled\"} , then you will not be able to import from this site.

Importing \uf0c1 Without an API Key \uf0c1 Without a key from the origin site, you can import all public items and collections, including their files. From the target Omeka Classic installation, where the plugin has been installed, go to the Omeka API Import tab on the left hand navigation of your administrator dashboard. Enter the API url of the origin Omeka installation (the base url with \u201c/api\u201d at the end, for example http://originomeka.org/api ). You must include the http://. See the Requirements section above for more information on finding the correct API url. Ignore the API Key field, since you are not using it. If you want to import annotations and changes to the element set on the target installation, check the Override Element set data checkbox. Note: this will overwrite all existing Element Set annotations and changes. Click Submit. Depending on the size of the collection at the origin installation, it may take a few minutes for the import to complete. With an API Key \uf0c1 If you have access to the admin side of the origin Omeka install, you can use one of the API keys assigned to a user to import users and private items and collections. See API Settings for more information. NB: only those users who have created items will be imported. To find an API key: Go to the Users link from the top navigation in the admin dashboard. Click on the Edit link below the name of the user whose key you wish to use. Note: Permissions for an API key follow the user\u2019s account, so for best results, use a SuperUser or Admin user\u2019s API key. Click on the API Keys link in the Edit User navigation.

This metadata standard, developed for audiovisual content, can be used to describe items and files. It does not replace the Dublin Core metadata elements in your Omeka Classic site. Configuration \uf0c1 No additional configuration is required for this plugin. Adding an Item \uf0c1 For guidance on using the PBCore metadata standard, please see the PBCore website . Once the plugin is installed, PBCore elements are available in their own tab when a user is either Adding or Editing an Item (on the same level as Item Type, File, Tags, and other metadata tabs). Users can complete as much or as little of the PBCore as they wish. If you input a 'Title' and a 'Creator' in the PBCore element set, those fields will overwrite any existing data in the DC metadata to facilitate browsing and sorting. (This will be particularly important to those using a media importer, such as the YouTube or Vimeo Importer, because those plugins any available metadata from the source site to the DC fields.) Each PBCore element has a description of the element (from the metadata standard) and an input field below. Use the checkbox below the field to use HTML formatting in this field. For elements with multiple values, use the Add Input button on the left to create additional fields. One of the features of PBCore is the use of related sub-elements, such as Contributor and Contributor Role . If you have more than one value to add to an element that has a related sub-element, use the Add Input button to create a field for each value and be sure to enter the values in a consistent order so that they are properly associated. The nested elements will be captured in the PBCore XML output from Omeka. However, in the web and admin interface, the sub-elements will be displayed as distinct. Controlling Displayed Metadata with Hide Elements Plugin \uf0c1 You may want to use the Hide Elements plugin along with PBCore in order to manage the possible duplication of the Title and Creator fields between the PBCore element set and the Dublin Core element set. When configuring the Hide Elements plugin, duplicate fields can be hidden on the Add Item form, the administrative view, the public view, and the search. Using the configuration form, you can customize where and who sees both the Dublin Core and PBCore elements. Adding Item File Metadata \uf0c1 In addition to the item metadata, PBCore offers instantiation metadata fields for the item files. Instantiation metadata can only be added if there is a file uploaded to the Omeka system. For files that exceed the size of the web interface upload limit, or to add many files at once, users can install and make use of the Dropbox plugin . YouTube Import and Vimeo Import plugins create an embed of the video file without actually importing the file. The importers spoof the creation of a file so that you can add instantiation metadata to the import. (Note, when using these importers you will want to copy any 'Title' and 'Creator' data into the PBCore fields to preserve that information because the plugin is designed so that the PBCore information overwrites the DC metadata for those fields .) To access the instantiation fields, first add your file to the item and save. Once your file is attached to an item, you can edit the file metadata by clicking on \"Files\" from the top item menu and then \"Edit\" to the right of the desired file.

Features \uf0c1 With the Scripto plugin, users can: Transcribe document pages Discuss document pages View contributions they've made View recent transcription and discussion history View the revision history of a page View revisions of a page View the difference between page revisions Revert to a previous revision Make a custom watchlist In addition to this, administrators can: Protect transcriptions and discussions Edit protected transcriptions and discussions Import transcriptions from MediaWiki as item and file metadata View corresponding MediaWiki pages Installing MediaWiki \uf0c1 This plugin requires you or your system administrator to download and install MediaWiki, a popular free web-based wiki software application that Scripto uses to manage user and transcription data. You should install MediaWiki in a separate directory from Omeka. It can be installed on another server and it must be accessible to the Web. Configuring Scripto \uf0c1 MediaWiki API URL: URL to your MediaWiki installation API . MediaWiki cookie prefix: the cookie prefix, most likely your database name. <dbname> if a table prefix is not used, -or- <dbname>_<tableprefix>_ if a table prefix is used (the trailing underscore is required for the cookie to work) NB: you can find these by looking in the LocalSettings file in the root of the server directory for your MediaWiki installation. You want the values of $wgDBname and $wgDBprefix (if it exists) Image viewer: Select an image viewer to use when transcribing image files. OpenLayers and Zoom.it can display JPEG, PNG, GIF, and BMP formats. Zoom.it can also display TIFF and ICO formats. By using Zoom.it you acknowledge that you have read and agreed to the Microsoft Zoom.it Terms of Service . Use Google Docs Viewer?: Use Google Docs Viewer when transcribing document files? Document files include PDF, DOC, PPT, XLS, TIFF, PS, and PSD formats. By using this service you acknowledge that you have read and agreed to the Google Docs Viewer Terms of Service . Import type: Import transcriptions as HTML or plain text?Importing will copy document and page transcriptions from MediaWiki to their corresponding items and files in Omeka. Choose HTML if you want to preserve formatting. Choose plain text if formatting is not important. Home page text: Enter text that will appear on the Scripto home page. Use this to display custom messages to your users, such as instructions on how to use Scripto and how to register for a MediaWiki account. Default text will appear if nothing is entered. You may use HTML. (Wrapping paragraph tags recommended.) Quick Start \uf0c1 Once you've installed MediaWiki and the Scripto plugin you can begin transcribing document pages: Open an item page as normal (the item must have at least one file); Click on one of the pages (files) under \"Transcribe This Item\". You'll be taken to a user interface where you can view, transcribe, and discuss the selected page; Click \"[edit]\" beside \"Current Page Transcription\", an edit form will open; Transcribe the page and click \"Edit transcription\"; Restricting Access \uf0c1 The Scripto interface is available to all users, but as a MediaWiki administrator you can restrict access to certain actions. By default, anonymous users can edit and revert pages. If you want to restrict these actions, you must follow these directions , and your users must create MediaWiki user accounts (see below). Creating Accounts \uf0c1 Scripto uses a separate login procedure from Omeka, so non-anonymous users must have a MediaWiki account and administrators must manage them via MediaWiki. (We recognize that this is not ideal, but the MediaWiki API does not provide the means to create accounts.) To create an account, users must: Go to the MediaWiki website Click \"log in / create account\" in the top-right corner Click \"Create an account.\" Fill in the information and submit the form If you do not want to allow anonymous account creation, you must follow these directions and create accounts for all your users. To create user accounts, you must: Go to the MediaWiki website Click \"Special pages\" in the toolbar Click \"Log in / create account\" under \"Login / sign up\" Click \"Create an account.\" Fill in the information and do one of the following: Fill in a password and click \"Create account\" Fill in an email and click \"By e-mail\" (The user will receive an email with instructions on how to complete their account creation. You can modify the account creation email by editing the MediaWiki:Createaccount-text page.) Importing \uf0c1 Once a document or page is transcribed, you may import the transcription from MediaWiki into Omeka. Importing a document stitches together all its page transcriptions and imports the result to the corresponding item. Importing a page imports to the corresponding file. All transcriptions are imported to the \"Transcription\" element in the \"Scripto\" element set. Import is only available to MediaWiki administrators. After logging into Scripto via the Omeka interface, two buttons will appear on the transcription page: \"Import Document\" and \"Import Page.\" Just click these buttons to import the transcription from MediaWiki to Omeka. Advanced Usage \uf0c1 Record Client IP Address \uf0c1 Scripto does not record a client's IP address by default. All modifications to pages will be set to the IP address of the server running Omeka. To record a client's IP address, you'll need to add the following code to LocalSettings.php: $wgSquidServersNoPurge = array('127.0.0.1'); Where '127.0.0.1' is your server's IP address. Base64 Decoding \uf0c1 Scripto Base64 encodes document and page numbers to prevent incompatible MediaWiki title characters. Because of this, corresponding page titles in MediaWiki will be unusually named. You may place the following code in LocalSettings.php to make page titles human readable: // Decode the MediaWiki title from Base64. // http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Hooks/BeforePageDisplay $wgHooks['BeforePageDisplay'][] = 'fnScriptoDecodePageTitle'; function fnScriptoDecodePageTitle(&$out, &$sk, $prefix = '.', $delimiter = '.') { $title = strtr($out->getPageTitle(), '-_', '+/'); if ($prefix != $title[0]) { return false; } $title = array_map('base64_decode', explode($delimiter, ltrim($title, $prefix))); $title = 'Document ' . $title[0] .

In order to use Text Analysis you must have the Ngram plugin installed and activated. The Text Analysis plugin uses two services: Watson NLU and MALLET Topic Modeling. Watson NLU will return the entities, keywords, and categories of a corpus; MALLET only returns topic models. You do not have to use both services but you must enter configurations for at least one in order to use this plugin. Because using Watson NLU may incur costs, the functions of Text Analysis are restricted to users with super and admin permissions. Before installing, you may wish to watch this screencast to better understand how to configure and take advantage of the functionality of this plugin. Watch screencast Configuration \uf0c1 After you have installed the plugin, go to the Plugins tab in the upper navigation, and scroll down to Text Analysis. Click the blue Configure button. The Configuration page has two sections, one for each service. To use Watson Natural Language Understanding (NLU) services to analyze text, you will need to create an IBM Bluemix account . Please note that there may be charges associated with using this service. Once you have an account, enter your Bluemix Username and Bluemix Password in the two fields provided. To use MALLET you must first download and install the toolkit on your web server. It may be easiest to install it at the same level as your Omeka installation (so that the mallet and omeka folders are in the same location). To find your MALLET script directory : go to your MALLET installation and navigate to the /bin folder. If using a FTP client, copy the full path as listed in the browser bar of your client. From a ssh client, navigate to the mallet directory and type pwd , then copy and paste the resulting file path. Create a Corpus \uf0c1 Create Corpus \uf0c1 To create a corpus, you will need to use the Ngram plugin (see that documentation for complete information on corpora). A corpus is drawn from the items in your collection with content in a particular text element (which is selected on the plugin configuration page), it is further defined by a Search Query and Sequence elements (on the Add a Corpus page), producing an Item Pool. The Item Pool will be further refined by Validating the Items. To create a corpus, go to the Ngram tab on the left hand navigation of your Omeka admin dashboard. On the Browse Corpora page, click the green Add a Corpus button. On the Add a Corpus page, complete the following options: Name : A field in which you must give the corpus a name. Ideally, choose something that meaningfully describes the corpora, as there are no descriptions for these corpora. Public : A check box. Click the checkbox to make the corpus visible to public users (on the public side of the site). Search Query : A field in which you refine the contents of your corpus by inputting a search query. The best way to get this search query is to perform an advanced search of the items in your collection on the Admin side of your Omeka site. Then, copy and paste the entire URL of the results, after the part that reads admin/items/browse? Sequence : If you use sequence, you will select from these sequence elements when viewing your corpus' text analysis (both NLU and MALLET). To conduct a text analysis on the entire corpus, do not use a sequence. Sequence Element : select from elements but it should be something with numeric or date input. Items without the selected element field filled in (for instance, an item without a Date will not be included in the corpus). For best results, ensure consistency of metadata, and select a meaningful field. Sequence type : choose from Date by Year, Date by Month, Date by Day, or Numeric Sequence Range. The field will prompt you with the proper format for the sequence if you choose a Date type. If numeric, make sure the format matches the numeric sequence of the elements you\u2019re drawing from. Note : Date should be entered in the YearMonthDay format and should be entered as a range. (for instance, 20010101-20160101) When you have completed adding your corpus, click the green Add Corpus button. Validate Corpus \uf0c1 After the Corpus has been created you must validate items before you can generate ngrams and view frequencies. To do so, click the green Validate Items button on the right hand side (just below the Delete button). This will take you to a new screen with three tabs: valid items, invalid items, and out of range items. Valid items are those items with sequence text that is readable to the plugin (See Figure 1). The table on this tab gives: the item number (a link to the item), the text in the sequence element, and Sequence member, or how it will be used in sequence by the plugin (Ex. when the sequence is \u201cDate by Year\u201d and the Sequence. Invalid items have text in the sequence element which the plugin cannot parse (See Figure 2). However, you can click on the Item ID number to go in and edit the item to correct the element text. Out of range items have text in their sequence element which is outside the range you set (See Figure 3). The table on this tab gives: the item number (a link to the item), the text in the sequence element, and Sequence member, or how it will be used in sequence by the plugin (Ex. when the sequence is \u201cDate by Year\u201d and the Sequence Note : to update the sequence text in these items, utilize the linked item number to modify each item. If you do not modify out of range items, they will not be included in the corpus. For ease of navigation, you may click to open a new tab for the invalid or out of range items you would like to modify. Refresh the list of valid and invalid items by reloading this page. Once you are done correcting invalid items, or the list of valid items looks correct, click the green Accept Valid Items button. Note : Once you click the Accept Valid Items button you will not be able to reconfigure the item pool or reset the body of valid items Valid Items (Figure 1) Invalid Items (Figure 2) Out of Range Items (Figure 3) Note : After you have validated your items, the Item Counts pane will update to provide a count of the number of items in your corpus. Using Text Analysis \uf0c1 Once you have created at least one corpus, navigate to the Text Analysis tab in the left-hand navigation of your dashboard. Analyze a corpus \uf0c1 To analyze one of your existing corpora, click the green Analyze a corpus button on the Text Analysis page. On the page which loads: Corpus : Select a corpus (generated with the Ngram plugin) to analyze from a dropdown menu of your Omeka site's existing corpora. Note that corpora cannot be analyzed until they have been validated. Features : Using checkboxes, select which sorts of analysis you want to run on the corpus. For NLU you can select Entities, Keywords, Categories and Concepts. MALLET has a single checkbox. Item Cost Only? Check this box to get an estimated cost of running NLU features on the selected corpus. Stopwords (MALLET): If you want to add stopwords for MALLET, enter whitespaced-separated words in this text box. The list of default stopwords for MALLET includes most common English-language stopwords. Note that carriage returns will count as whitespace in this field, should you need to copy and paste a list of stopwords. Once you have configured these settings, click the green Analyze Corpus button. Once you have clicked the button, you will return to the main page for the Text Analysis plugin tab. The page will display the message \"Analyzing the corpus. This may take some time. Feel free to navigate away from this page and close your browser. Refresh this page to see if the process is complete.\" Corpora which are being processed will show up in the table of corpora with the Process status \"In Progress\" View analysis \uf0c1 Once you have analyzed at least one corpus, the Text Analysis page will display a table of analyzed corpora with the following columns: Name : name of the corpus. Includes a delete button to remove this analysis. Process : will either display as \"In Progress\" or \"Complete\" NLU Analysis : Once the process is complete, the NLU Analysis column will display one or more of the following: the item cost; either a dropdown to view analysis by sequence element (set in the corpus) or a link to view if there was no sequence element; if you selected \"Item Cost Only\", this column will only display the cost of the running the processes. MALLET Topic Model : Once the process if complete, the MALLET Topic Model column will display either a dropdown to view topic models by sequence element (set in the corpus) or a link to view if there was no sequence element. To view analysis, click view or select from the dropdown for MALLET or NLU. NLU Analysis \uf0c1 If your corpus had sequence elements, select one from the dropdown in order to view the analysis for that sequence. Otherwise, simply click View. Viewing the NLU Analysis will present you with the following tabs, most of which correspond to various AlchemyLanguage features : Overview : which summarizes the item and element analyzed, the word count for the element along with number of Unique words, the character count, text size, and the full text of the element being analyzed. Entities displays a table of named entities (as defined by NLU) in the text, with columns for entity, type, sentiment, count, and relevance. A glossary above the table defines each column. Keywords displays keywords in a table with columns for the word or phrase, associated emotions, sentiment score, and keyword relevance score. keywords based on context and relevance in the overall text sample. A glossary above the table defines each column. Categories applies the NLU categories to your content. The table shows the label for the categories identified and the confidence score for that category. Concepts are given in a table with the concept and relevance; the words and phrases are generated by computation extraction and may not be referenced in the text. Analysis will on display for those features which you selected when you ran the analysis. To see more features, re-run the analysis on that corpus and select the desired features. MALLET Analysis \uf0c1 If your corpus had sequence elements, select one from the dropdown in order to view the analysis for that sequence. Otherwise, simply click View. All topics load on a single page. At the top of the page is an option to navigate between sequence elements. If you did not have a sequence element, this will load as n/a. Regardless of the size of the corpus (whether your corpus has 50 or 500 items), ten topics will be generated. Topics are displayed in order of occurrence, highest first. Each topic will display with its percentage and a cluster of words found in that topic. In this instance, percentage refers to the percentage of the sequence assigned to a given topic, or how relevant each topic is to the sequence. Each topic also comes with a line graph in order to enable users to visualize the percentage for that topic. Please note that not all topics will add up to 100%, as percentages are rounded up to the nearest whole number.

Just sync your library to the Zotero server, tell the Zotero Import plugin what library you want to import, and it'll pull in source items, notes, files, and web snapshots. Features \uf0c1 The plugin imports Zotero libraries and collections, including source items, notes, files, and web snapshots. Web snapshots are zipped up directories containing the files needed to render the web snapshot. To minimize data loss that often occurs when migrating between systems, the plugin adds a new element set to your Omeka install which contains elements identical to the fields used by Zotero. In addition to mapping data to the Zotero element set, the plugin maps data to the native Dublin Core element set to maximize interoperability and ease integration with Omeka. The Zotero element set is large, but the plugin provides a helper function to build strings from the elements therein. The plugin also adds a field to the advanced search page that narrows search results by Zotero item type. Every Zotero item has an item type, so it's a helpful way to sort through your items. Requirements \uf0c1 Sync Zotero library : The Zotero library must be synced to the Zotero.org server prior to import. To import files, the Zotero client must be set to sync attachment files. You can find instructions on how to do this at the Zotero website . Note: the import will not work from Zotero Standalone. Atom Feed URL : Every Zotero library and collection has an Atom feed URL. You can find this URL on the library or collection page of the Zotero website, under \"Subscribe to this feed.\" Unpublished libraries do not have a feed URL readily accessible, but you can construct it using the following URLs as templates: user library: https://api.zotero.org/users/%7BuserID%7D/items user collection: https://api.zotero.org/users/%7BuserID%7D/collections/%7BcollectionKey%7D/items group library: https://api.zotero.org/groups/%7BgroupID%7D/items group collection: https://api.zotero.org/groups/%7BgroupID%7D/collections/%7BcollectionKey%7D/items The user or group owner can get you the userID, groupID, and collectionID. Private key : To access access private libraries and collections and to download attachments (files and web snapshots), a private key is required. A key is not necessary to access citations saved in public libraries and collections. The owner of the library can generate private keys in their account settings . Private keys must be set to allow third party access. PHP Zip extension : Zotero stores web snapshots in ZIP files containing files with Base64 encoded filenames. The import plugin attempts to decode the filenames using PHP's Zip extension . If your server does not have this extension installed, the plugin does not decode the filenames. The import will still save web snapshots, but the filenames will be obfuscated, making access near-worthless. Installation and Importing \uf0c1 If you want to import all file types, you must disable file upload validation in Omeka Admin > Settings > Security Settings before import. Once you've installed the plugin, go to the \"Zotero Import\" tab in the admin interface and fill out the form (/admin/zotero-import). To fill out the form, you will need find the feed URL to the Zotero library you want to import and, if desired or necessary, a private key to access those sources. Click \"Continue\" to begin the importing process. Depending on the size of the library, the import process may take some time to complete. Because of this we suggest that you log background processes: In omeka/application/config/config.ini make sure log.processes = true In omeka/application/logs/ make sure a processes.log file exists and is writable. These steps are not required but will be helpful if something goes wrong halfway through a long import. It's important to note that the import process is only as stable as the Zotero API. If you encounter errors, delete the import and try again. Are your jobs starting and not completing? You might need to set the path for PHP so that your system can perform the background process to make the items. Stopping and Deleting an Import \uf0c1 If you make a mistake, you may stop an import at any time by clicking \"Stop Import\" in the Zotero Import admin panel. You may also delete the items from an import after the process finishes, by clicking \"Delete Import.\" Deleting imports will delete all imported items and files.","title":"Zotero Import"},{"location":"Plugins/ZoteroImport/#zotero-import","text":"With this plugin you can move your Zotero research into Omeka Classic, making it possible to further organize and exhibit your Zotero library.

Instead, you can choose to use the PECL ext/imagick extension (Omeka 2.2 and above) or the PHP GD extension (Omeka 2.3 and above). The Imagick and GD options both avoid the need to call out to a command-line. PHP's GD extension is less advanced than ImageMagick but is more widely available. To change how Omeka will generate thumbnails, set the option fileDerivatives.strategy in the application/config/config.ini file. Note: there may be a fileDerivatives.strategy line already in the config.ini file. If that line starts with a semicolon, it is a comment, not an actual setting. Either remove the semicolon and edit the line to use the desired strategy, or just add a new line. To use the GD strategy, use the following line: fileDerivatives.strategy = \"Omeka_File_Derivative_Strategy_GD\u201d To use the IMagick strategy, use the following line: fileDerivatives.strategy = \"Omeka_File_Derivative_Strategy_Imagick\u201d The new strategy will only apply to files added to Omeka after the configuration is changed. Changing Options \uf0c1 In addition to the entire strategy used to create the thumbnails, more fine-grained options are also configurable in application/config/config.ini. Options are set using lines starting with fileDerivatives.strategyOptions . Gravity \uf0c1 The gravity option lets administrators specify which region of an image to keep when creating a square thumbnail. The possible options are compass directions (north, south, east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast, and southwest), and the default, center. Directions that contain \"north\" or \"south\" will use the topmost or bottom-most portion, respectively of portrait-oriented images. Directions containing \"west\" or \"east\" will use the leftmost or rightmost portion, respectively, of landscape-oriented images. A setting of \"center\" or no setting will use the center of the image. For example, to always make square thumbnails using the topmost part of the uploaded image, set the following line: fileDerivatives.strategyOptions.gravity = \"north\u201d Page \uf0c1 The default external ImageMagick strategy can switch which \"page\" of an image to use when creating a thumbnail. The \"page\" could correspond with actual pages for documents like PDFs, or to frames of an animation or video. The page numbers start at 0, so 0 is the first page, 1 is the second page, and so on. By default, Omeka uses page zero, the first page. For example, to use the second page when creating thumbnails, set the following line: fileDerivatives.strategyOptions.page = 1 Version \uf0c1 When using the default external ImageMagick strategy, you can optionally inform Omeka which version of ImageMagick is being used. If it is recent enough, Omeka can switch to creating square thumbnails in a way that is more efficient and produces better results, particularly for images that are much longer in one dimension than the other. Running the command convert -version will indicate the version of ImageMagick that is installed. fileDerivatives.strategyOptions.version = \u201c6.9.0-0\u201d Auto-Orient \uf0c1 Requires Omeka 2.3.1 or newer The default external ImageMagick strategy and the Imagick strategy both support a flag called autoOrient , which defaults to off. When turned on, Omeka will look for embedded orientation information in uploaded files, and rotate or transform the thumbnails it creates to account for that orientation. A common use-case for this is images taken with mobile phone cameras, which often embed an orientation flag to allow computers to automatically rotate the image. Some image manipulation or preview software also will store rotations as only a change to the image's embedded rotation information.

To use the GD strategy, use the following line: fileDerivatives.strategy = \"Omeka_File_Derivative_Strategy_GD\u201d To use the IMagick strategy, use the following line: fileDerivatives.strategy = \"Omeka_File_Derivative_Strategy_Imagick\u201d The new strategy will only apply to files added to Omeka after the configuration is changed.","title":"Choosing a Strategy"},{"location":"Technical/ConfiguringThumbnailCreation/#changing-options","text":"In addition to the entire strategy used to create the thumbnails, more fine-grained options are also configurable in application/config/config.ini.

The possible options are compass directions (north, south, east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast, and southwest), and the default, center. Directions that contain \"north\" or \"south\" will use the topmost or bottom-most portion, respectively of portrait-oriented images. Directions containing \"west\" or \"east\" will use the leftmost or rightmost portion, respectively, of landscape-oriented images. A setting of \"center\" or no setting will use the center of the image. For example, to always make square thumbnails using the topmost part of the uploaded image, set the following line: fileDerivatives.strategyOptions.gravity = \"north\u201d","title":"Gravity"},{"location":"Technical/ConfiguringThumbnailCreation/#page","text":"The default external ImageMagick strategy can switch which \"page\" of an image to use when creating a thumbnail.

When turned on, Omeka will look for embedded orientation information in uploaded files, and rotate or transform the thumbnails it creates to account for that orientation. A common use-case for this is images taken with mobile phone cameras, which often embed an orientation flag to allow computers to automatically rotate the image. Some image manipulation or preview software also will store rotations as only a change to the image's embedded rotation information. Turning autoOrient on allows Omeka to produce thumbnails in the expected orientation when these types of images are uploaded. fileDerivatives.strategyOptions.autoOrient = true","title":"Auto-Orient"},{"location":"Technical/Configuring_File_Storage/","text":"Configuring File Storage \uf0c1 Omeka Classic allows administrators to configure how files are stored (both original files uploaded to Omeka Classic and the derivative images Omeka creates itself). For typical users, the default settings are sufficient: files are simply stored the files subdirectory of the Omeka installation and served from there by the web server, just like any other file in Omeka. However, if you want or need to store files in a different location, on a different drive, or even a different server or service, you'll need to do some configuration. The storage system is configured through the Omeka configuration file, application/config/config.ini . Note: storage changes in the configuration get applied immediately, and will affect all operations involving files. If you change storage methods or locations after already working on an Omeka installation for some time, you'll have to take care of moving or copying any pre-existing files to the new location yourself. If you're thinking about using non-standard storage settings, it's often easiest to make that decision up front, before you upload anything. Storage Adapters \uf0c1 Omeka's storage system is based on \"adapters.\" An adapter is simply a method for storing and accessing files, and Omeka ships with two adapters out of the box. The default adapter is the Filesystem adapter, and it just stores files on the local server. If you haven't explicitly chosen an adapter to use, you're using this one, and it's the right choice for most users, especially if you're not sure which you want to use. The second adapter included with Omeka is the ZendS3 adapter, which uses Zend Framework code for storing files on Amazon's S3 storage service. This is a more complex adapter, and it requires you to sign up for S3, but it can be the right choice if you have constrained local storage and a large set of files to deal with, or just want to store files remotely for whatever reason. You set the adapter with a line storage.adapter in the configuration file. This configuration option accepts the name of an adapter class. For the built-in adapters, the class name will start with Omeka_Storage_Adapter , so the Filesystem adapter would be Omeka_Storage_Adapter_Filesystem , and the ZendS3 adapter would be Omeka_Storage_Adapter_ZendS3 . Plugins can add their own adapters too, and the plugin should document for you how it needs to be configured. Remember, if you don't explicitly choose an adapter (in other words, if you don't have a storage.adapter line in your configuration file) then Omeka will use the Filesystem adapter. Adapter Options \uf0c1 Each adapter has some options that can be set to change its behavior. These options differ from adapter to adapter. Adapter options are set with storage.adapterOptions. lines in the configuration file (for example, to set the localDir option for the Filesystem adapter, you'd use a line like this (obviously with a real path instead): storage.adapterOptions.localDir = \"/local/path/to/store/files\" Filesystem Adapter Options \uf0c1 localDir \uf0c1 The directory where files will be stored. If this is not set, the directory is set to the files subdirectory of the Omeka installation by default. Just like is true for files in a normal installation, whatever directory you choose here must be readable and writable by the local user Omeka executes as (often, this is the web server user). For visitors to be able to see the files, they'll need to be served by a web server. For the default location, this is taken care of automatically, as Omeka is already served by your web server along with the files in the Omeka directory (including the files subdirectory). When you change localDir to a custom setting, you almost always also need to set webDir (see the next heading). webDir \uf0c1 The URL path to the directory given in localDir . By default, this is the root URL for the Omeka installation plus /files , to go along with the default for localDir . Omeka doesn't do anything by itself to serve files, it just stores them in the specified directory and calculates the URL for them. A web server like Apache is required to actually serve the files to users, so you'll need to set up a server to serve the files from your localDir . If you choose a localDir that is within the \"document root\" of a web server you already have set up, you may be able to do this without any additional reconfiguration. This option needs to be an absolute URL, like https://example.com/files . Only the URL up to the directory needs to be provided; Omeka will handle the part of the URL for referring to a specific file and type of file (in other words, this option is the prefix for the file URLs). ZendS3 Adapter Options \uf0c1 Unlike the Filesystem adapter, the ZendS3 adapter has several options that are mandatory and have no default. So, to use this adapter, you must also always set at least some settings. The ZendS3 adapter requires you to have an Amazon S3 bucket set up. accessKeyId \uf0c1 Your AWS access key ID. If you are unsure about what this is or how to get it, refer to Amazon's documentation on credentials . This option is required. secretAccessKey \uf0c1 Your AWS secret access key. If you are unsure about what this is or how to get it, refer to Amazon's documentation on credentials . This option is required. bucket \uf0c1 The name of the S3 bucket to store files in. This option is required. expiration \uf0c1 The number of minutes a URL is valid for. By default, this is infinite. Omeka will generate plain direct URLs to your files stored in S3, which means links that work as long as the file is still there. This requires the bucket to be configured so anonymous users can view the files. If you instead want to have a locked-down access policy, you can set this setting, which will cause Omeka to generate pre-signed URLs for files stored in S3. The effect is that links to files will only be valid for the configured number of minutes after the URL was created. endpoint \uf0c1 The S3 endpoint for the region your bucket is located in. By default, this is s3.amazonaws.com , the endpoint for the US-East (N. Virginia) region. If you're using a different region, you can set the correct endpoint for it here. Amazon's documentation lists the S3 endpoints for different regions . Note: The ZendS3 adapter only supports \"Version 2\" authentication. Regions listed as \"Version 4 only\" in the linked table cannot be used with the ZendS3 adapter. forceSSL \uf0c1 This setting will use HTTPS urls for files stored in S3. It is useful to prevent mixed content errors/warnings when the Omeka site is accessed via HTTPS. Setting the Temporary Directory \uf0c1 There is one storage option that is used regardless of the configured adapter: storage.tempDir . This option takes a local path to the directory Omeka should temporarily store files in while initially working on them. Omeka copies files here, and also performs operations like creating thumbnails here. Plugins that work with files as they're uploaded can also access files in this temporary directory. By default, this is the system default temporary directory, but on some systems that directory isn't accessible to Omeka and a different directory needs to be used. In those cases, set the appropriate path with storage.tempDir in the configuration file. Omeka needs to be able to read and write in this directory, just like in the storage localDir .","title":"Configuring File Storage"},{"location":"Technical/Configuring_File_Storage/#configuring-file-storage","text":"Omeka Classic allows administrators to configure how files are stored (both original files uploaded to Omeka Classic and the derivative images Omeka creates itself).

There are two possibilities: You forgot to copy the .htaccess file when FTPing your install. Double check that it transferred properly. Your server may not have mod_rewrite installed. If installing mod_rewrite does not solve the problem, check that your Apache configuration allows .htaccess overrides. You will need the AllowOverride All directive in the appropriate place in httpd.conf . File Upload Errors \uf0c1 If you are receiving errors related to file size uploads, you will need to look at your PHP settings and possibly contact your server administrator. The upload.maxFileSize limit in Omeka\u2019s application/config/config.ini is only useful for decreasing the limit, not for increasing it. It is there to restrict uploads in Omeka more narrowly than your PHP settings already mandate. It is not set by default and plays no role in increasing the upload maximum size. The php.ini setting upload_max_filesize is a limit set by PHP that constrains the maximum size of any one file. If this is smaller than a file you want to upload, you need to increase it. The php.ini setting post_max_size is a limit set by PHP that constrains the maximum total amount of data that can be sent in any one request. This includes uploaded files as well as any regular form data (the contents of text inputs and textareas, for example). This setting must be at least as large as upload_max_filesize for that setting to have any effect, and generally should be larger, to allow for some data to be sent alongside a large file and/or to allow multiple large files to be uploaded at once. Omeka Classic will read all three of these settings and display the largest file upload size in the \"Add New Files\" block on the the Files tab when adding or editing an item. Of these three, it\u2019s most often post_max_size that\u2019s the problem, as PHP has some odd behaviors when you exceed that limit which can make the cause of the error a little less obvious. The others tend to give you fairly clear error messages. Getting Better Error Messages \uf0c1 A blank or white screen is often an indication that Omeka or PHP has encountered an error. Since error messages can often contain private or technical information, Omeka hides them by default. See Retrieving Error Messages for instructions on how to show these messages. The content of error messages can be extremely useful for troubleshooting, so try these steps before seeking further help.

It is there to restrict uploads in Omeka more narrowly than your PHP settings already mandate. It is not set by default and plays no role in increasing the upload maximum size. The php.ini setting upload_max_filesize is a limit set by PHP that constrains the maximum size of any one file. If this is smaller than a file you want to upload, you need to increase it. The php.ini setting post_max_size is a limit set by PHP that constrains the maximum total amount of data that can be sent in any one request. This includes uploaded files as well as any regular form data (the contents of text inputs and textareas, for example). This setting must be at least as large as upload_max_filesize for that setting to have any effect, and generally should be larger, to allow for some data to be sent alongside a large file and/or to allow multiple large files to be uploaded at once. Omeka Classic will read all three of these settings and display the largest file upload size in the \"Add New Files\" block on the the Files tab when adding or editing an item. Of these three, it\u2019s most often post_max_size that\u2019s the problem, as PHP has some odd behaviors when you exceed that limit which can make the cause of the error a little less obvious. The others tend to give you fairly clear error messages.","title":"File Upload Errors"},{"location":"Troubleshooting/Troubleshooting_Omeka/#getting-better-error-messages","text":"A blank or white screen is often an indication that Omeka or PHP has encountered an error.
